He snapped to\r\nconsciousness but his eyelids remained heavy as he listened. There\r\nwere voices shouting excitedly in a language he didn’t recognize.\r\nThe reverberations of heavy boots made him tense. Quick steps\r\napproaching, his muscles contracted. He planned to pounce. His\r\nfingers closed on the small leather ball in his left hand, the\r\nonly device by which to defend himself. Peering through his\r\neyelashes he caught a glimpse of the uniformed men circling above.\r\nCarefully he tried to slow the hammering of his heart keeping his\r\nsenses alert, he waited for his moment.<br>\r','\r\n<br>\r\nThe rough touch of coarse fabric covered his back and his head\r\ntilted slightly as a mirror captured his breath on its surface.\r\nMore excited discussion from the men hovering above followed. His\r\nbody lost none of its tension. Their words were directed at him\r\nbut he could not comprehend their meaning. His crooked glance\r\nfollowed the bootlaces up, past ochre trousers until his eyes\r\nsettled on an olive-toned jacket made of a machine-woven fabric.\r\nThe red-cross patches on the man’s shoulders identified them as a\r\nmedic. He rolled back to get a better look at his face and the\r\nbear of a man beamed him a friendly smile. Under the concerned\r\ngaze he sagged his tightened shoulders. His heart began to beat\r\nwith excitement whilst he racked his brain for a shared lexicon.\r\nAll he could manage was a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medic seemed pleased and bent to one knee to examine him\r\nfurther, gesturing with his hand to introduce himself as Michele.\r\nClosing his eyes, he allowed Michele to rub feeling back into his\r\nlimbs with strong but not brutish hands. He watched Michele’s face\r\ncrease with concentration, a large moustache gave him the\r\nappearance of a walrus. Lilting, melodic words were spoken over at\r\nhis boy companion, as the medic pressed his flesh like a butcher\r\nfinding a prime cut. Seemingly assured there were no signs of\r\nbroken bones, the medic squeezed his shoulder with a genial\r\nfirmness. He let out an involuntarily grunt which was met with\r\nnodding approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger soldier gave him some congratulatory words. The beads\r\nof sweat on their brows indicating their relief; he quickly\r\nunderstood the rareness of his situation. All around him the dead\r\nwere left to rot, their numbers too great for the survivors to\r\nbury. Twisting his body around, he sat upright. He accepted a\r\nfresh pat on the back from the youth. He thought that it must have\r\nbeen the younger man who found him surrounded by so much flotsam\r\nand called for the medic. He offered a smile to the boy, barely a\r\nscrap of meat in his ill-fitting uniform, and shook his soft hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n“Brother,” Michele offered him a fur-covered, hard canister,\r\n“Drink.”<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn’t pause to acknowledge his victory in deciphering the\r\nman’s tongue and took the canister to his mouth. Gratefully, he\r\nlet a trickle then a flood of the cool liquid drip down his\r\nparched throat. He felt the container lighten and politeness\r\nstopped him from finishing the entire contents. He panted his\r\nthanks in the man’s native Frankish and noted the visible signs of\r\nrelief in their facial expressions. They hadn’t lost their\r\nwariness of the dangers he posed as a stranger. Whatever divisions\r\nbetween their side and their enemy, they had helped and not tried\r\nto identify him first. Even supposing that a living prisoner was\r\nworth more to their superiors than a dead corpse, he thought well\r\nof them. He could not know what malice he might have avoided but\r\nhe was grateful he would be able to know them outside of the ugly\r\nrealities of the situation. The relief on their face told him that\r\nhe had sidestepped whatever torturous fate would have been in\r\nstore for him otherwise. They would not have to burden their souls\r\nwith that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n“My thanks,” he tuned his accent to the rural south of Frankia,\r\n“Please, help me stand.”<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe offered his right hand and the pair pulled him to his feet.\r\nStanding, he lost his footing in the uneven, sinking mud. The men\r\nquickly grabbed him as he crouched, seeking a more sure-footed\r\nbalance. The blanket slipped off his shoulders and he shivered.\r\nHis hairless body exposed to the biting wind, his older rescuer\r\nquickly unbuttoned his own jacket and put it around him. The\r\nmatured sweat clinging to the soft lining mixed with the\r\nbackground aroma of decay, unsettling his stomach. He hid the\r\nflash of nausea and welcomed the borrowed warmth. Fastening the\r\nbuttons to protect his chest, he looked down at his exposed\r\nmanhood. They were past any sense of dignity, wallowing shamefully\r\nin industrialized savagery. The three of them laughed,\r\nacknowledging the absurdity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n“Here,” Michele let go of his arm and pulled his backpack down,\r\npropping it between his legs. “I usually carry a spare. Plenty of\r\nfolk crap themselves first outing. Although I have not seen many\r\ncompletely naked after the fighting!”<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a pair of standard issue soft-plastic waterproof\r\ntrousers, rolled tightly and unfurled them, presenting them for\r\napproval. Michele’s arms were thick with black hairs. The tattoos\r\ncovering his shoulders and biceps marked him as a member of the\r\n14th Brigade, the lover of a big-busted lady called Denise and a\r\nperennial believer in the Eternal Light. The Scripture quote inked\r\nbeneath the cross was a poor translation, its sentiment code for a\r\ngeneral intolerance of a maligned ethnicity. Michele noticed him\r\nappraising the words and shrugged, waving the plastic trousers for\r\nhim to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n“Young and stupid,” he gave a dismissive touch of the markings,\r\n“Not that you have to worry.”<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became aware of the uncircumcised evidence and took the\r\ntrousers, bobbing his head in gratitude. Stepping into them, the\r\nlegs were a matching length, hanging over his bare feet. The rope\r\ncord around his waist pulled the material in snugly and he\r\nreceived another congratulatory pat on the back. Ever step of his\r\nrehabilitation to a clothed brother-in-arms appeared to merit\r\nencouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time spent dressing allowed him to place himself in the axis\r\nof events stretching across entropy, on many worlds. The turn of\r\nthe 20th Century uniforms; the tattoos that would soon become\r\nunfashionable; the Frankish tongue spoken by men more used to\r\ntilling the fields; their searching for life in ground pounded by\r\nindiscriminate artillery. He tried to identify the battle from its\r\naftermath. There was no ruined city and no blanched tree stumps.\r\nThere were no tracks visible made by colossal land-ships. The flat\r\nfield was nestled between rough mounds of sundered hills. Verdun\r\nor Somme, he wondered. “More importantly...” his voice escaped and\r\nthe two sets of on-looking eyes narrowed in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlight panic gripped him as he scanned the horizon. Inevitable yet\r\nunwelcome, the sound of projectiles breaking overhead, their\r\nthunderous descent followed by the clashing sound of tin\r\nshattering. The serpentine hiss of canisters releasing billowing\r\nclouds of sulfuric powder sparked the two Frankish men into\r\naction. Burdensome gas masks were pulled on their faces, the older\r\nman helping the panic-stricken youth. They had checked the\r\nintegrity of the enclosure around their faces twice before they\r\nremembered him, standing before them unprotected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man who had said nothing throughout was gripped by fear\r\nand could only stare at him, a stream of piss staining his\r\ntrousers. If the youth could detect the look of serenity upon his\r\nface, he could not understand it. Inside the boy’s mask he could\r\nsee tears well up as the yellow death wrapped around them. He was\r\ntouched by the youth’s desolate sobs, but he too was frozen in\r\nplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas irritated Michele’s exposed arms. Quickly blistering his\r\nskin, the puss filled pustules bubbled and burst. The agony\r\nvisible on his face he could not resist scratching the exposed\r\nskin. His face contorted until a beatific relief imprinted on his\r\nfeatures when finally giving up, he ripped off the mask. His lungs\r\nflooded with blood, contracting his breath and extinguishing all\r\nresistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youth looked at him with horror as they watched Michele die,\r\nhis cherub face adorned with a puzzled expression. His own face\r\nbetrayed nothing as he focused all his attention on willing his\r\nown cells to cauterize against the invading chemicals. He watched\r\nthe boy through a telescopic prism, his fingers wanting to reach\r\nout to him in futile consolation. All he could think was that he\r\nnever learned the boy’s name. He watched as the seeping, heartless\r\nmolecules worked upon him. His clothing offered only a few extra\r\nseconds of protection. The effects were predictable as the\r\nyouthful face was quickly ravaged by spasms of pain. He barely\r\nheard the death rattle of the boy, his mind retreating into a\r\nquiet cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mustard clouds ebbed away and released him from his paralysis.\r\nHis body gave way and doubled over. He heard remote sobbing,\r\nunrecognizable and alien at first. The whelping sound crept closer\r\nuntil he felt it pounding from his chest. He reached out to the\r\ncorpses of the two Frankish men. No different to the others around\r\nhim, yet more intimately tangible. His dehydrated body offered no\r\nfurther tears. His anger ebbed away, he stowed his grief and\r\nretracted his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body convulsed as he stood, reforming sinews and giving\r\nstrength to his renewed shell. There was no place for rage, no\r\ntime for guilt, only certainty and thankfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n“Thank you,” he looked beyond the field, “for making me feel\r\nhuman.”<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked onward.</div>',NULL,'2015-03-05 01:41:22','2015-03-05 12:02:48',1,'the-field','f111312f-9710-419d-ab70-73f24cdf69ad',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2013-01-18 05:00:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(7,'Article','Political Utopianism and Nation Building','monkeyx','<blockquote><p>\"Since the end of the Cold War, political theorists have been\r\nscrambling to define the nature of the new world order. Samuel\r\nHuntington, Francis Fukuyama, and Joseph Nye, among others, have\r\nall made varyingly successful contributions to the ongoing\r\ndebate.(1) However, even the most insightful efforts have been\r\noverly academic, with no serious attempt made to link the nature\r\nof this new world to practical policy initiatives.</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n\"In this spirit, it is past time to discard a number of academic\r\nillusions about the international system. The greatest danger\r\ncomes from schools of thought that differ in practice but derive\r\ntheir essence from Kantian utopianism. They proclaim that our\r\nsystem of universal values consigns us to an undiscriminating,\r\nopen-ended foreign policy, even after the debacles of Somalia,\r\nKosovo, and Haiti. Surely the recent October Bosnian elections,\r\nwhere nationalists, many of whom advocate secession from Bosnia\r\nproper, easily triumphed over their Western-sponsored moderate\r\nfoes, must close the curtain regarding the efficacy of such\r\nnation-building endeavors.\"</p></blockquote>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20021129114308/http://www.inthenationalinterest.com/Articles/Vol1Issue10/Vol1Issue10Hulsman1.html\">The Rebirth of Realism: The Kantian Trap--Utopianism in\r\nInternational Affairs &mdash; Prager.</a><br>\r','\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nThe article is a critique of the humanitarian Utopianism inherited\r\nfrom Wilson, the multilateral utopianism and the neoconservative\r\ndogma. It''s conclusion, a call for realism, is interesting if a\r\nlittle unhelpful:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote><p>\"In all the turbulence of a changing world order, one particular\r\nparadigm has been almost totally neglected. Ironically, we have\r\nabandoned realism – the one doctrine that can best navigate our\r\nrole in the uni-multipolar world we find ourselves in. For if we\r\nhold that the attempt to remake our global history of conflict and\r\nchaos into a hopeful future of peaceful order is an illusion, then\r\nwe must accept the anarchic nature of our world and attempt to\r\nlive in it as best we can. Specifically, we must create policies\r\nthat recognize and place our national interests above all other\r\npriorities--and not draw the wrong lessons from history in\r\nconceptualizing the future.\"</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>It is my view that utopian ideologies, whether they are founded\r\non economics (such as Marxism or raw Capitalism) or religious\r\nfaith (such as Islam) or military prowess (such as that advocated\r\nby the American neoconservative hawks) are ultimately destructive\r\nand the source of conflict. It is human nature to model perfect\r\nsystems but it is human frailties which make our ability to model\r\nperfection a losing gambit.</p>\r\n<p>In many a discussion with more idealistic friends, my views on\r\nthe value of ideals versus their perception of cynical realism has\r\ncaused many a long, heated debate. Idealism, especially as it is\r\nexpressed by the young, is a valuable thing. It gives us theory,\r\nhope and ambition to change. However, from ideal to practice\r\nsacrificies have to be made, data interpreted and new theories\r\narived. Most people learn this the hard way in their own lives:\r\napplying a set of ideals (i.e. theory) and learning from the\r\nmistakes. In the political sphere, when ideals are given power,\r\nthe danger is always that the dogmatic persuit of ideals leads to\r\ndisaster.</p>\r\n<p>The problem with pushing this argument is that idealist will\r\nalways proclaim it is the failure to follow through 100% with the\r\nideals that are the cause of an idea to fail. Marxists say the\r\nSoviet experiment of less than a century failed because Lenin,\r\nStalin etc. failed to follow Marx'' vision fully. Muslims say the\r\nfailure of Islamic states is that they haven''t followed the\r\nmoderate principles of Islam as they see it. Hippies will no doubt\r\nattest the ''love and peace'' movements abject failure by the 1970s\r\nwas a function of the right-wing backlash.</p>\r\n<p>That is the danger of ideals when they become dogma because noone\r\ncan apply them practically in a world where some level of\r\ncompromise has to be achieved between what is possible and what is\r\ndesired. That is after all the art of politics or simply put the\r\nfunction of human interaction.</p>\r\n<p>So given the abject failure of idealism, should we all become\r\ncynical realists? Yes and no. Ideals have a great value because\r\nthey focus our energies, set down our principles and order our\r\npriorities. Without ideals we become reactionaries moved only by\r\nthe most innate of our beliefs: self-preservation, greed for\r\ncomfort and prestige and our desire to reproduce. The success of\r\nhumanity as an organism has to be associated by the measures we\r\nhave taken to meet these basest of requirements with sophisticated\r\nsystems to ensure we are not subject to as much of the haphazard\r\nforces of nature other animals endure.</p>\r\n<p>So ideals are fine and dandy but they must be approached by a\r\nsense of their limitation and within the context of the Scientific\r\nMethod as a ''working theory'' to be discarded or adjusted given\r\ntheir proven failure. Without theory our understanding of an\r\nexperiment is shallow or nonexistent, without ideals our realism\r\nis meaningless.</p>\r\n<p>So in a way I regard the British Labour Party as a triumph of\r\nthis realism based on idealism. The cynics decry that Labour is\r\nnow as right-wing as the Tories. I think they just grew up. In the\r\nEighties, Labour was hopelessly idealistic which no doubt gave\r\ncomfort to the young activists who live in a perpetual dreamland\r\nof possibilities. However, it failed to acknowledge most people''s\r\naversion to dreaming and their concern with living awake. In the\r\nlate 1990s Labour changed but I don''t believe it lost its innate\r\nbeliefs: the need for social justice. That is what marks them out\r\nfrom the Conservatives.</p>\r\n<p>So back to the issue of American foreign policy. America is an\r\nidealistic country, much more so than most of Europe and perhaps\r\nthis is a function of its immaturity or perhaps a function of its\r\nsuccess. It seems American ideals have never been a single\r\ncohesive ideology but whatever end of the political spectrum they\r\nare tied on the same set of principles. Historically American\r\nidealism has been caricatured as naive, insensitive, heavy-handed\r\nand plain just stupid. It is with mocking tones the European media\r\ncriticises the cowboy from Texas who doesn''t get the reality of\r\nthe situation. The British are still seen as the ultimate\r\ndiplomats, the political realists who are there to temper the\r\nyoung American foolhardy nature. But I think this is a\r\nmisrepresentation of the Americans, with all their inward looking\r\nignorance of the world, which have illustrated their idealism is\r\nmatched by pragmatic practicioners who push forward the American\r\nagenda forcefully and realistically.</p>\r\n<p>So in the current climate of the US it has been interesting to\r\nnote the idealistic tones of neoconservatives and the realistic\r\nmanagement of that agenda by the US Administration. The lack of\r\nforceful opposition is indicative of the power of the ideals and\r\nthe expertise in management of the required realism of that\r\ngovernment.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the real test of American power is not their ability\r\nto execute on whatever they believe now, because they have the\r\npower and resources to push any agenda, but how America will deal\r\nwith the failures of that policy. For every policy has a little\r\nbit of failure. Ideally, whilst playing at establishing American\r\norder on the world (via an expanded, vassalised NATO or military\r\naction in ''rogue states'') it will address the other problems which\r\nit must do. Its dependence on oil would be number one on any risk\r\nassessment and controlling more oil sources is perhaps one\r\nsolution whilst they remain sceptical about the impact of burning\r\nfossil fuels on the long-term viability of our ecosystem. If they\r\nprove right and it is neglible then no matter but I suspect (and a\r\nlot of scientists concur) that this is one blindspot that will be\r\npainful to ignore longterm. The other blindspot seems to be on the\r\nbalance of individuals and corporations within the republic but\r\nAmerica more so than most other countries has a constitution which\r\nattempts to meet these concerns, even if their legislature has\r\nnot.</p>\r\n<p>So as an outsider whilst I fear the shift to militarism I remain\r\noptimistic that the forces within America will redress the world\r\nin a way that is better off than in the past. So let American\r\nadventurism take them to the Middle East if they are willing to\r\ncommit their future wealth on such a task. The coming conflict\r\nwill be painful and costly for their new subjects but perhaps that\r\nwill sweep away the cobwebs of age old and redundant dogma that\r\npervades there. Hopefully too the reaction to this application of\r\nforce will also serve as something with which Americans will too\r\ngrow their ideals. If nothing else, 9/11 caused America to address\r\nthese issues but I suspect this will be an evolving thing which\r\nwill take more than this current set of ideals to address.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 08:13:45','2015-03-05 12:08:42',1,'political-utopianism-and-nation-building','9f030f5e-9b1d-494e-9446-5f756600211a',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2002-11-21 13:18:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(8,'Article','Paradise Lost - Book I','monkeyx','<p>I recently started re-reading John Milton''s Paradise Lost which I\r\nhaven''t read since my teens, during a period of insatiable\r\nconsumption of literary classics. A good deal of this epic poem\r\nhas formed our cultural perspective on the story of Genesis, so\r\nthe hasty reading of years ago didn''t quite do justice to the\r\nbeauty or depth I have found in a more meditative reading. I''m\r\npurposefully not going to rush this and contemplate each of the\r\nten books in some depth. This isn''t so much a review of a\r\nwell-known classic but an effort to pick apart the verses to learn\r\nsomething relevant today. This will intentionally be out of the\r\ncontext of the poem''s historical inception, an area where more\r\nscholarly analysis is abundantly available.</p>\r','\r\n<b>Book I</b><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>And high disdain from sense of injured merit,</p>\r\n<p>That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,</p>\r\n<p>And to the fierce contentions brought along Innumerable force of\r\nSpirits armed,</p>\r\n<p>That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,</p>\r\n<p>His utmost power with adverse power opposed</p>\r\n<p>In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The first book begins by outlying the premise of the work with\r\nMilton calling upon his muse Urania, recast as a Christian\r\ninspiration, to recount the Fall of Man. The story of Adam and\r\nEve, the Garden of Eden, the Serpent and the Tree of Knowledge of\r\nGood and Evil are probably familiar to everyone, even those who''ve\r\nnever read Genesis. Milton picks up the story in the midst of\r\nthings with Satan cast down to Hell after the failed rebellion in\r\nHeaven.</p>\r\n<p>Obviously, to those already familiar with Satan''s role in the\r\nFall and those who believe in God, he is clearly cast as the\r\nvillain, the antagonist of the Biblical story of creation. He is\r\nvainglorious, charismatic and defiant of God''s will. However,\r\nMilton''s portrayal is notably nuanced and there is a sense of\r\ncompassion towards his fate. This isn''t simply a fiery sermon\r\nwarning against the perils of invoking God''s wrath. It begins with\r\na lament as to what was lost and lays on the reader what\r\ndistinguishes Satan from other souls who have turned against God.</p>\r\n<p>Satan was once God''s most highly favoured creature, the Morning\r\nStar, the most charismatic, intelligent and mighty of the spirits\r\nof Heaven. Whilst Milton gives us only the briefest accounts of\r\nwhat Heaven is like, it is clearly a place of grace, light and\r\npeace. We will learn in greater detail how the Son, who in\r\nMilton''s telling came after the creation of Heaven and the angels,\r\nmade Satan envious and in doing so brought forth Sin into\r\nexistence. It is envy of God''s power, resentment towards God''s\r\njudgement upon the throne and ambition to overthrow Him that\r\nbegins Satan''s fall from grace. It is also clearly outlined that\r\nuntil Satan attempted this ultimately futile and foolish act,\r\nthere was only God''s word as to his Almighty stature. It is God''s\r\nmercy and love that had belied the fact that He was all powerful.\r\nSatan''s pride compelled him to challenge this claim, as God no\r\ndoubt intended, and try in vain to usurp the throne of heaven.</p>\r\n<p>We also learn that a good number of angelic creatures, many of\r\nthe greatest perhaps of the angelic hosts of Heaven, were\r\npersuaded by Satan to join his cause. The Prince of Lies is\r\nportrayed as highly persuasive and as an inspirational leader who\r\nseems to favour subtle influence rather than giving loud commands.\r\nIn formulating a plan for his own redemption, without accepting\r\nGod''s sovereignty, he whispers his strategy but allows others to\r\nmake the arguments for and against. He sets in motion the events\r\nthat lead to Man''s fall and Hell''s war on the World not through\r\ndisplays of muscular coercion, of which he is more than capable.\r\nInstead he brings others to his way of thinking. He does this\r\nwithout even appearing to have had a direct hand in the process\r\nitself.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that these spirits of heaven, these\r\nfallen angels, are not one-dimensionally evil although they\r\nacknowledge and embrace their evil nature more so than most men\r\nwould ever admit, even in the privacy of their own thoughts. They\r\nhave qualities that make them admirable to men; after all, a\r\nmonstrous creature in which man could not recognise anything good\r\nwould be a poor temptress. More than this, these are creatures\r\ncreated by God who is good. It is in them to be good, to find\r\nredemption and to use their gifts to bring praise to the Almighty.\r\nIt is perhaps those very generous gifts that led to the pride and\r\ncorruption that made their fall so great. So when Satan speaks he\r\ndoes so with an admirable spirit of resilience, despite his\r\ncurrent predicament. When he wishes to inspire, he does not shirk\r\nfrom putting himself in danger. In fact, his pride and ambition\r\ncompels him to lead from the front. He is truly a figure of heroic\r\nproportions, capable of beguiling man to admire him greatly.</p>\r\n<p>The spirits who have fallen into the lake of fire after the\r\nfailed war of heaven are many, but it is Satan who rises first and\r\nafter some contemplation awakes the others. We learn about some of\r\nthe most mighty fallen in the first book.</p>\r\n<p>Beelzubub is Satan''s right hand and to whom he puts the question\r\nof whether given their recent loss they should submit to the will\r\nof God. However, the question is couched in the language of\r\nresistance and it can only lead in one direction. Satan is not\r\nprepared to make peace with the \"tyranny of Heaven.\" Beelzebub is\r\na familiar character, the loyal lieutenant who toads along to\r\ngreat power and relishes in evil deeds. His role is to console his\r\nmaster, to pledge his allegiance even after such a terrible\r\ndefeat. He acknowledges that God is Almighty for only the truly\r\npowerful could have defeated them but even in the unending torture\r\nand pain of Hell, he is unwilling to repent. His loyalty would be\r\ncommendable if it were sincere but Beelzebub is as calculating as\r\nmany a general of an evil dictator. He is, quite literally,\r\nbetting it is better the devil you know. Once the old allegiances\r\nare established, Satan outlines his plan to continue the rebellion\r\nthrough guile rather than force of arms. This seems obvious as the\r\nonly course of action but it is shown as a testament of Satan''s\r\nintelligence and stubbornness. It illustrates his manipulative and\r\ncalculating nature in that he already knows his will on this\r\nbefore the show of the consultation with the other Princes of\r\nHell.</p>\r\n<p>The depictions of the legions of Hell and their fallen situation\r\nis lengthy and full of references to Biblical and classical\r\nstories. Milton casts many of the gods and spirits of the\r\npre-Christian world as fallen angels, who would later be named by\r\nmen, their heavenly names scrubbed from existence. Before the\r\n\"great consult\" begins in Book II, we are given the vision of\r\nMulciber, the artificer and fabled craftsman, building\r\nPandemonium, Satan''s city in Hell; whilst Mammom leads the\r\nexcavation of the riches of Hell, vast in gold and gems.</p>\r\n<p>These two fallen angels represent the evils of avarice and\r\nattachment to worldly things, to works by mortal hands, pride in\r\nthe temporal rather than praise of the eternal glory of God. It is\r\nthrough their skill and labour that evil builds its foundations.\r\nThey are the tools by which the charismatic Satan will wage his\r\nwar from a secure fortress. It is the innovation of Mulciber and\r\nthe affection for treasure of Mammon from which evil learns\r\nsophistication. It is also easy to recognise in these characters a\r\ncommon polemic against measuring worth by worldly things. In this\r\nMilton''s views seem to be grounded very much in his own\r\nimpoverished life experience. It is also a common tract of\r\nChristian thought that struggles against the juggernaut of the\r\nvalues of the material world. The resonance of the crafts of Hell\r\nwith its great riches in corrupting the spirit is timeless. Given\r\ntalent and the bounty of heaven, these fallen angels fell so hard\r\nthey found a perverse happiness in their new element. As we learn\r\nin the dialogues to follow, even with the eternal suffering of\r\ntheir situation, they preferred to bask in their material riches,\r\nforsaking everything else including heavenly salvation.</p>\r\n<p>The first book of this epic poem is striking in the rationality\r\nof the infernal actors in their fallen state. Their values strike\r\nfamiliar chords in their elevation of power, cleverness, loyalty,\r\nbravery and material wealth. It is easy to get lost in the\r\ndepiction of their suffering, to view it all as grand imagery and\r\nbecome numb to their self-inflicted torment. They like the reader\r\nbecome accustomed to their situation. Instead of seeking\r\nredemption, they quickly focus on making the most of the place for\r\nsome illusory advantage. Even with the recent memory of God''s\r\npower fixed in their minds, they remain intransigent to accept His\r\nmercy. Their immortal spirit only briefly acknowledges, in defiant\r\ntones, that the peril they suffer could be worse. Their existence\r\ncontinues and they show despite their eternal nature a fear of\r\nannihilation. It is also clear they need leadership and hope. Even\r\nin Hell there is hope for the wicked but they remain misguided,\r\nseeking their own path to salvation by their own works. In not\r\nacknowledging God as their creator and redeemer, they illustrate\r\nthe folly of pride and the dangers of following their ruinous\r\nleader.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 12:09:50','2015-03-05 12:15:56',1,'paradise-lost-book-i','9d2656b3-cd85-47d5-997e-3a818e0a940e',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2013-01-09 17:15:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(9,'Article','An Inconvenient Elder','monkeyx','<p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2013/01/14/130114crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">In a review</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Francis-Assisi-Afterlife-Medieval-Saint/dp/0300178948\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">two</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Francis-Assisi-A-New-Biography/dp/0801450705\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">new</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;biographies of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Francis of Assisi</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">, Joan Acocella writes:</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Francis was a good example of what, in the annals of history, might be called the “inconvenient elder”: the person who starts the revolution and then, once it succeeds, becomes an inconvenience, even an embarrassment, to the next generation. (Think of Gandhi.) They honor him—they have to—but they wish he would go away, so that they could “work within the system” and relax a little.</p>\r','\r\n<p>The tragedy of a radical or revolutionary figure lies in their natural&nbsp;obsolescence if they are successful. The alternative is relegation to a romantic figure whose ideas never found favour. St. Francis is perhaps a victim&nbsp;of&nbsp;both fates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His self-enforced&nbsp;poverty and willingness to minster to those outside of society without seeking a radical overthrow of the social structure has made him both a champion and villain to those who care about the poor and inequality.&nbsp;He was catholic in his adherence to the Church, believing in their special authority in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist\">Eucharist</a>&nbsp;that he saw as essential in his personal salvation. Whilst going to Rome to avoid his fast growing movement being labelled heretical, he preferred to keep it at arms length whilst he had the influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His compassion tempered his uncompromising&nbsp;principles; a template for a spiritualism that stood in contrast to the grubby&nbsp;ostentatiousness and narrow interpretations of the Church. As a layman who lived the Gospels, an evangelist born from a middle-class background in a time and place with crumbling morals, he might have been a natural hero of the Reformation movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact this was not necessarily the case may be because how&nbsp;compromised by materialism his eponymous movement had become by the&nbsp;sixteenth-century. Or perhaps there was a backlash against the hagiographies dedicated to him, with their attributions of great miracles. In any case, by the time he was being revitalised by Protestant writers the story of St. Francis had become conflicted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The accounts of a genial, jovial and caring man were in contrast to the embittered elder of a movement that was&nbsp;co-opted&nbsp;by the Church to resemble one of so many gaudy orders that thrived on earthly privilege. Some of this may be attributed to a dying man''s growing conservatism. He was on his death bed wise enough to suggest the road he travelled was not necessarily the best path for the salvation of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He remains a controversial and inspirational figure, a mad man to some, a true disciple of Jesus to others. Despite the many biographies of him written over the centuries, even those drawing upon Francis'' own writings, seem to find it difficult to be certain of the&nbsp;real&nbsp;Francis. What is perhaps more pertinent is that at a time when social inequality is perceived to be at a modern peak; when austerity is the prize hangover brought about by the mismanagement of the elite, St. Francis of the 12th-13th Century should still draw sufficient interest for two new biographies to be published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also&nbsp;some&nbsp;comfort in his story, as the NY piece concludes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cites the nineteenth-century historian Ernest Renan, who said, as Vauchez summarizes it, that the example of Francis “constitutes proof that Christianity, at least once, has been lived by a human being in all its radicality within the context of a historical life: this allows us to sustain the hope that this great movement, taken and distorted by the Church, might be able one day to resume its influence.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 12:17:31','2015-03-05 12:26:46',1,'an-inconvenient-elder','4100de27-3a1d-44ed-a36c-f93b95db7a41',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2013-01-10 17:26:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(10,'Article','Head First','monkeyx','<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He reached into his pocket and retrieved a small ball. The pale, flesh-tone leather was scratched and sooty in the palm of his left hand. With his thumb he fastened it in place. Shifting and twisting, he freed his shoulders from the tweed jacket and wriggled free letting the worn patched garment drop to the muddy bank of the lakeside. He unbuttoned his chequered shirt. The heavy cloth dropped down to his waist and hung upturned, tucked into his denim jeans. His left hand occupied, he used his right to unfasten the brown fabric belt. Unbuttoning his trousers, he angled with his pelvis and wormed them down to his ankles. Using his right foot for leverage he kicked the worn trainer off his left foot. He stepped off the small mound of clothing as he removed the remaining shoe. The cold, squelching of treacly mud oozed around him as heart racing with anticipation, a bead of sweat ran down his cheek defying the chill.</p>\r','\r\n<p>Stepping forward onto the smooth rocks at the water''s edge, he dipped his toes in. The spring water stabbed icy sensation along his tired feet. Glancing around his eyes followed the tree line overhanging the lake. The early morning light bathed the leaves in an autumnal glow. Above, a flock of birds wheeled, their chorus breaking the quiet of the isolated clearing. Their departure returned a stillness that was only disturbed by the rare fish splashing in the shallows. Looking at his toes, he saw the pebbled bottom of the lake was less than knee deep. He wiggled them and the algae growing on the rocks left a soft resin on the soles of his feet. He couldn''t put it off any longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sharp tug, he stripped off his boxer shorts. Naked and shivering he fixed his eyes on the middle pool of sunlight hanging upon the lake. He stepped backwards. Three wide, measured steps. Gripping the little ball, he stuck out his left hand towards the lake. With the nail of his right index finger he scratched a new mark on the leather and blew on it as he pulled his arms back to his sides. He inhaled and burst forward with great leaping strides. His toes hit the edge of the water and he jumped. Somersaulting up before pirouetting head first into the rocky lake bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top of his silver-streaked blond hair made contact with the glassy surface. Immediately the water hardened; slightly thicker at first, glue-like, then instantly, a thick crystal shattering on contact. Three inches beneath the glassy surface, the water became a solid sheet of metal and his body reverberated with the backlash. For a moment the naked man was suspended upside down, legs scissored inelegantly, held in place by a few inches of water. Water which was now harder than treated steel; the shock wave broke his spine and blood poured out of his nose as fluids rushed to escape his broken body. He sagged and crumbled like a burst balloon. His innards dissembled into a black silk stream of nothingness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He gripped the leather ball fiercely as he plunged into a void of growling harmonics, a cacophony pulling him apart. The feeling of his thumb on the small ball pressed tight into his palm all that remained of his awareness. Absent pain signals made him numb. His mind spiraled unhinged into uncertainty. He struggled to remember the incantation in the fog of fading thoughts. He fought to ignore the ragging stream of memories flooding his attention with nostalgia and centering himself, began to follow the deeply practiced path of establishing the axioms that would open the World Way to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I think,\" his thumb pressed upon the ball for precious resistance, \"Therefore, I am!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blackness gave way to a misty grey and his nearly forgotten nostrils flared with the stench of saltpetre and decaying bodies. He grew more confident and begun to flex his physicality, willing his right hand to reach out; kick starting his reflexes into action. He turned from a notion into a solid idea reforming as the trigger words arced through the nothingness like lightning seeking solid ground. His right hand reached forward, palm spread outwards assuming a protective guard for his face. His tongue tasted iron-soaked mud. He lifted his head to spit and expel the foul substance. His blood stained eyes caught a glimpse of the field of fallen men. Multitudes of bodies twisted, pierced and torn, ground into the trodden earth. His senses overloaded with the sight and smell of death, he managed the briefest of exhausted smiles before he collapsed into unconsciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 12:27:45','2015-03-05 12:29:11',1,'head-first','e8c9fe6e-6c64-4f70-9c69-1ff6408f4e14',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2013-01-11 17:28:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(11,'Article','Paradise Lost - Book II','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The second book of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">John Milton''s</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Paradise Lost</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;uses a device that is familiar to most fantasy literature that has followed: the quest giving council.

Who can advise may speak.</p>\r','\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The council begins with Satan attempting to snatch victory from the recent defeat against the power of Heaven. The clever postulation presented to the princes and powers of Hell will be familiar to any student of earthly dictators. As the leader of the rebellion against the throne, Satan lays claims to the most severe punishment, the greatest fall from grace and in doing so puts to rest any question of who would wish to replace him. After all, given what they know now, who would challenge him? Who would want to suffer as he is suffering? In such a way, an issue that may have become contentious had they succeeded is put to rest. His credentials established he subtly warns against factionalism and with cunning invites others to advise him on the path ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The model of the charismatic revolutionary leader who has burnished his record with suffering under the yoke of tyranny is recognisable in historical figures such as Mao, Lenin and Hitler. The revolutionary council of Hell in turn presents arguments familiar in tone to the disaffected of any unloved regime. Of course, earthly kingdoms are imperfect and their tyranny sometimes worthy of revolt. However, it is not hard to draw parallels between the moral weakness found in the portrayals of the denizens of Hell and those who would overthrow one tyrannical regime in order to replace it with their own dictatorship. And there can be no doubt that Satan, despite his inclusive demeanour, seeks to rule in Hell; to replace the throne of God with his own. Proud enough to believe he can outmatch all his rivals in any contest, his nature is not to contest against them but to subvert them to his cause. To do this, he allows others to debate whilst playing his own cards close to his chest until the right moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First to speak in the council is the classic brute, an unsophisticated argument from Moloch, who represents the&nbsp;seething hatred brought about by an overriding desire for vengeance, regardless of the cost. His argument is simplistic and defies logic: having lost to an Almighty power, they should resume the conflict at a disadvantage because in doing so they deny their victor the prize of peace. Moloch is rage incarnate, the madman who kills the innocent and throws his own life away. He recognises strength and fighting prowess are meaningless in the game of deceit and corruption that would play to Satan''s advantage. Yet he has no means by which to influence those not already similarly disposed, of which there are quite a number. His fate is to be mocked by the next prince to speak for his unsophisticated position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belial speaks with a forked-tongue, appearing more noble than the brutish Moloch but his thoughts consumed with ignoble pleasures. He turns Moloch''s desperation and acknowledgement of the futility of open conflict against him. He disheartens his fellows with talk of the impregnable fortress of heaven''s defences. He goes further than just advocating no open war, he wishes no conflict at all. He uses the fear of defeat, of a worse fate at the hands of the Victor, to mask his desire to wallow in the situation and seek what pleasure he can from his surroundings. Belial represents the compromising evil that has no courage, no purpose but to enjoy himself. Even bathing in the shit of Hell would be more preferable to him than further struggle. He speaks eloquently and is portrayed as appealing to the eye but his heart is consumed by lazy corruption. In him are manifest sloth and a portrait of the worst human lawyers and apologists for evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next speaker is Mammon who begins by acknowledging the futility of great ambition, the vanity of attempting&nbsp;to overthrow the throne of heaven. He proceeds to outline the only sure way of leaving Hell for the fallen spirits: the acceptance of God as their sovereign. This is not something he will countenance as in mocking terms he reveals his hatred of God. Instead, he proposes to take the riches of Hell and build a new order. There is an interesting but false analogy, often used by rich men who forfeit God''s grace, in using moral relativism to claim for himself the ability to recreate heaven in hell. This is the root of Mammon''s fall, to value his own labour and proudly claim to match or exceed God in his works. He looks at wealth as the reward, the goal of his undertaking and all the wealth he covets is to be found in hell. What use then of heaven? What profit in God''s mercy? And to turn away from God through resentment of his wrath, to place your trust in the riches of the earth is Mammon''s folly. Of the arguments made thus far, this is the most pleasing to the assembled host of fallen spirits. It is the most pleasing to hear because it offers the mirage of a self-made salvation: the pursuit of worldly riches, in place of a servile life in praise of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the court draws to a conclusion once Beelzebub, acting as Satan''s mouthpiece, finally speaks. He clarifies the simple truth for the rest: there can be no peace, they are prisoners of heaven, not masters of a nether empire to be yet formed. Hell is torture and punishment, the riches of it are ashes in the mouths of those who have tasted heaven. Could the punishment be worse? Perhaps, but how would they provoke God further than his omniscience has already allowed? If He wanted to destroy them or punish them further, He would have done so already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open war would be futile given His power but acceptance without repentance would achieve nothing either. None of the assembled are prepared to repent so it is to guile and deceit they have to turn if they wish to upend the order of creation. It is through their own free will they have to subvert God''s plan if they wish to escape their circumstance. The vanity of it all is striking and there would be no hope for it. However, the creation of the World and Man upon it gives them an opening, Beelzebub argues. For in man, the fallen spirits see a way out of Hell. A way to a place, not quite heaven, but certainly better than Hell. And through man, they could have the triumph of domination they seek. Finally, their greatest victory would be in turning Man away from God. If vengeance is their goal, he advocates, then what better way to stick it to the divine than turn the creatures that He loved more than the angels against Him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beelzebub gives the denizens of Hell everything they could want in his speech and its clear this is Satan''s plan all along. Vengeance for their Fall, vindictiveness against God, a vainglorious desire for power and sovereignty over Man. So the stage is set as Beelzebub calls on a brave spirit to break out of Tartarus and head beyond the realms of Chaos to find the World. To seduce Man for the fallen angels or conquer the paradise given to them by God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is of course Satan''s cue to rise up at this point and display his majesty and awesome power above his peers, and take the quest upon himself. Of course, he makes much of the dangers ahead to dissuade anyone who may wish to tag along now he has accepted the challenge. His is a quest without fellowship built on pride and he is unwilling to share the glory with any other. He is utterly effective and the other spirits fall to worship him as a god Emperor. As he makes his way to depart, the fiends disperse and sow the seeds of evil in preparation. Satan had given them what they most needed in the absence of heaven''s mercy: leadership and hope. A plan for living their eternal existence without accepting their punishment. In their legions, they go about establishing their fiefdoms and hell is less of a prison in their mind than a staging ground. How quickly they seem to forget heaven and embrace their nightmarish surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Satan puts on ''swift wings'' and travels to the edge of his new domain, the landscape rich with borrowed mythology such as the guarding spirits of Cerberus and Medusa, until he reaches the first boundary. The gate is guarded by his daughter Sin whom he does not recognise nor does he recognise the shape that is Death, sprung from their incestous relationship. Its noteworthy that Satan doesn''t know who they are at first and it is Sin''s lament that informs him of their connection. Ravaged by hell-hounds born from Death''s rape of her, set to cause her endless torment, Sin has been entrusted to keep the key to the gates of Hell by God. A duty she doesn''t fulfil with much diligence; given the opportunity, she sides with Satan against God. The metaphors of this triad of spirits is obvious enough: Satan brings Sin into being through jealousy and pride, Sin brings about Death when none existed before and Death is Sin''s punishment. The theology presented here is a little narrow-minded, dating the poem but it is a worthwhile exposition on the foulness brought about by Satan''s disobedience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gates of Hell are opened and will not be closed until later when the Son defeats Satan. He continues his mission through the vastness of Chaos until the powers beyond grant him knowledge of the World. Loving nothing more than to bring destruction and profit from the mischief Satan will cause, they help him. The rest of Satan''s journey is smooth sailing and with the thought of revenge on his mind, the second book closes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second book is a familiar narrative template for the epic adventure.&nbsp;The story of Satan''s quest to corrupt man, set forth by the council of the Princes of Hell, has only just begun. Milton has given us an insightful portrait of the ruinous powers and florid depictions of the underworld that have endured over the years. There is much to consider philosophically but it is a strange affair to follow the villain in the place where a hero would normally tread.

But as soon as someone turns off the music, such as suggesting a corporations earnings or assets are misrepresented, the whole house of cards falls down. Business auditors only extend this problem by giving the illusion of accountability but their interests are not served if important clients lose out due to their work.

But when business is life and drives government the only measure of success is the accumulation of wealth by the rich. The definition of stakeholders needs to be extended to consider the (world / local) community and the environment. The short-termism of profit making needs to be replaced by the long-term goal of wealth generation.

But that is not to say that this limits the story in any way because Ms. Smith covers such a breadth of topics from WWII through to modern genetics.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>The issues that it brings up are handled senstively but with great humour. I particularly loved that the characters argue the multitude points of views without the author sounding preachy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>The book offers an insight into world events of the last quarter of a century from a multitude of atypical perspectives. From heated discussions as the Berlin wall comes, watched on Telivision, down to the rise of Islamic militancy in suburbia, whilst smoking grass in the schoolyard. It covers these topics almost with grace, always from the characters'' perspective, always with humour and uncanny insights.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>But central to what makes this novel work so well is the characters whom I found were three-dimensional and quirky. Whilst they fitted profiles I could recognise, they were not stereotypical in the cliched way. Through them you feel you have experienced the hormonal energy of youth, the confusion of age and worries of domesticity. However, the twins sons seem to be there merely as symbolic backdrops, almost playing a role in a game which works its way through the final half of the novel.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>Ultimately the books many threads come into an all too neat conclusion which whilst leaving the story finished makes the characters feel less real. This is one of those books that you wish would go on for longer and you get the sense the author just became tired and decided to conclude the story. However, the conclusion like the many plots that run through the novel are not merely distractions from the character development or examination of the issues this book raises. They are imaginative and exciting and the last part of the book will have you racing through it.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>In summary, this is a most interesting look at the culture I grew up and I''m sure many will identify with the book. For others it may offer an insightful look into issues of identiy and ethniticy as well as the role of science, politics, religion and world events have to play on the everyday lives of people. But ultimately what makes this book so compelling is the empathy you will feel for the characters and the charm with which their many foibles are portrayed.</p>\r\n',NULL,'2015-03-05 15:13:12','2015-03-05 15:15:55',1,'white-teeth-by-zadie-smith','f811b580-b2e9-4e1b-bc83-00208ee834d2',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2002-06-30 19:15:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(18,'Article','Immigration as a Good Thing','monkeyx','        <p>It may not be the most popular thing to say given the rise of right wing, anti-immigration, anti-Islam politicians in Western Europe but I''m going to do what politicians should be doing: argue in favour of immigration.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>In fact, I hope to illustrate that Europe more than most places on this planet needs immigration and it is immigration that will fuel long-term prosperity, not the racist slogans of \"rivers of blood\" whose echoes are still heard today.</p>\r\n         ','\r\n        <p><strong>Economic Contribution of Immigrants</strong>:</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>Whilst the focus traditionally is on the costs of immigrants in terms of public services few consider the benefit that an immigrant population brings to the economy. Immigrants provide a welcome influx to the tax base of aging nations with ambitions to meet growing public services demand by \"natives\". Most immigrants may not be the high wage earners but they contribute both in terms direct income tax and more so in indirect taxes such as sales tax / VAT.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>The very thing that drives immigrants into Europe / America is a sure indicator of the value that immigrants bring to these regions. Primarily, immigrants are motivated to escape the poverty and hopelessness that exists in oppressed or depressed nations elsewhere. They seek the improved living standards and supposed opportunities which the Western media promotes. When they arrive here they generally work, albeit often in dubious legal circumstances, and spend money. Spending money is an important contribution to the economy.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>The next most often cited resentment against immigrants is that they \"steal jobs\". In one sense, immigrants having had to make substantive personal sacrifices and shown greater determination to succeed than perhaps the privelaged natives do indeed build enterprises and promote positions within them internally usually in the family unit. This has been the pattern of all immigrants with the notable exception that modern day immigrants do not try to kill or subjugate the natives in these developed countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>However, the suggestion that immigrants are able to compete with the native population for legitimate jobs is laughable given the innate racism or at least race preference in recruitment by any Western institution. Even if you''re a director for AMD you better not bring attention to your origins, race or faith. The only competition that immigrants provide is on the lowliest of jobs, often below the safeguards placed by governments, where immigrants, particularly \"illegal\" immigrants, are willing to sacrifice dignity in order to attain some prosperity for their children.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p><strong>Future Prosperity and Immigration</strong>:</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>There is plenty of historical evidence to suggest countries that have high immigration experience great periods of growth. There is also some evidence that nations with closed borders and declining birth rates decay and are soon consumed by more vibrant nations. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;evidence that immigration has been harmful to the long term growth of any nation.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>To take a scientific analogy, it may be argued that monocultures are the surest way to get yourself extinct. There is also a strain of historical argument that indicates the success of Europe lies not just in its temperate climes but also in the genetic diversity due to immigration, war and conquest throughout its history. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;evidence, except the rhetoric of racists, that cross-racial breeding leads to individual or more ridiculously national decay.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p><strong>Racism</strong>:</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>There is a fear common to any overprivelaged, minority anywhere in the world and that is the fear of loss of status. White Americans and Europeans realise that in the world picture if not at home they are a minority that can only dominate the world stage for so long. This is indeed the autumn of White Imperialism. It is through this historical reference of atrocities committed and liberties taken against supposed primitive people that haunts white racists as much as it haunts any oppressor.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>Racial dogma is not unique to Europeans or their descendants in the Americas. It is a common trait of all imperialistic, tribal people and some socialists would argue the device with which the powerful keep in check their subjects.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>Much like the rise of Nazism, it can be noted that the rise of anti-immigrant rhetoric and rise of nearly- or wholly-fascist politicians fits in line with the rise of unnemployment, disenfranchisement due to loss of influence in the global economic machine and in Europe greater federalisation. As in the past, immigrants make a good scapegoat because they are visible. It is hard to blame the rapid movement of electronic currency, the cycles of consumer spending and skimming politicians when all you have to do is look on the impoverished immigrants for the cause of economic decline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>The irony is of course that when mainstream politicians take the easy road by not actively promoting immigration and indeed cultural diversity they cause more harm to the economy. Racial tension and anti-immigration policies do nothing to alleviate the economic troubles of nations. Often the assumption with these policies is that there is some wealth that is better distributed to non-immigrants rather than accept the greater evidence that by reducing immigration you reduce economic growth.</p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>Protectionism of markets is arguably advantagous in the short term but long term prosperity suffers. It is like national work programmes or expanding governmental beauracracy. In the short term it creates opportunities but a truly free market, including free movement of labour, is a surer way to ensure international competitiveness.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 15:43:57','2015-03-05 15:45:41',1,'immigration-as-a-good-thing','d3ed514e-1f35-4927-b19a-5fbc510822b9',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2002-06-30 19:44:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(19,'Article','Disruptive Influences','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Most of the technology I work with today is driven from the top down (e.g. Java, XML) but it is the bottom up technologies that often offer the greatest real benefits and fulfill a real need.

In fact the big boys such as IBM didn''t believe in it and it took a few upstarts like Microsoft and Apple to capitalise on this and earn themselves substantial wealth in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal computing is the classic definition of disruptive technology I will use. It has the following traits:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>It is multipurpose and yet has no specific purpose</li>\r\n\r\n  <li>It is open and standardised and eventually becomes just a commodity.</li>\r\n\r\n  <li>It begins in the hands of a few dedicated non-commercial enthusiasts and is often adopted at a rate that the major institutionalised corporations just can''t fathom.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\r\n  <li>It changes the way people work or live</li>\r\n\r\n  <li>It has a killer application that makes it almost universally desirable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal computing may be games and office productivity to most people but that is not all that it is. It is music or video editing; it is a communication tool; it is an information terminal; it is a desktop publishing system; it is many things to many users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that it is highly commercialised doesn''t make it a non-disruptive technology but illustrates how market forces are highly adaptive in mid- to long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no need to even argue it has changed lives because whether it has improved them or not, the world of early 21st Century is quite different because of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Open Source Software</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Source may be a political movement and have its ancestry in the work of Free Software movement but as a technology Open Source offers something that caught a lot of people off guard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that open source / free software of high quality is available to replicate the work of most commercial software or in a lot of cases to provide better software than available from the commercial software is in itself disruptive. The fact that it became widespread and adopted by the technically minded illustrates how quickly a grassroot technology movement can gain ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is most disruptive about this technology is the method by which it is created and the effect of building open source software has had. Closed systems have never had it so hard. Even properietary technologies such as Java have had to open their doors to accomodate a shift in what the end users, developers in this case, find acceptable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Peer to Peer (p2p) networks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer to Peer started well before Napster but it was definitely the biggest commercial proponent (if you could classify its unsuccesful business as commercial) and it certainly was the killer app. Yet p2p is more than Napster or file sharing. The principle is used in providing anonymous web browsing, distributed computing (e.g. SETI@home), chatting and data storage. It has suffered a setback in its killer domain but it is definitely now mainstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>p2p changed the way people view the edge of the network and its utility. It moved away from the Sun / Novell vision of the network dominated at the center to a network which utilises the growing capacity and power at the edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its direct cousin, GRID computing, is bearing fruit in the commercial world and people are finding ways to commercialise the Napster model of media distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ad-Hoc Public Wireless Networks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like personal computing the components or the underlying infrastructure of this disruptive technology is provided by industry but the manner of its use is a grassroot phenoma. Perhaps the most&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020812002223/http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/21300.html\">publicised example is that of Seattle</a>&nbsp;but it is fast spreading across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People are using Wireless networks to build communities and to circumvent incumbent telco monopolies. They are using it to take control away from broadband providers. The Internet may be a centralised and controlled network but these certainly aren''t. They express much of the same sentimentalities for non-commercialism and sharing that has got the corporations scared about p2p and open source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now commercialisation was bound to follow and that is a sign that the idea is so popular that the bosses are taking notice but will they capture the mood? According to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020812002223/http://www.monkeyx.com/archives/%3Ca%20href=\">this article&nbsp;</a>it is not entirely understood by the mainstream media or the big corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personal Content / Personal Delivery</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dot coms tried to commercialise the Internet far too quickly for either the infrastructure (i.e. lack of broadband) or users were willing to accept. However, this has had a nice side effect in that broadband is finally becoming a reality for a lot of people in developed countries (and elsewhere) and the infrastructure is in place for a much more grassroot push.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the height of the bubble there was fear that the corporations would dominate content delivery and the content produced. Sure Microsoft, Yahoo etc. rule the roost as far as page impression are concerned but the fastest growing segment of Intenrnet content is produced by individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is of course deliverying that content from your own broadband connection or hosted server. As costs for both are reduced the market place for advertising heavy free web hosting will deteriote as web hosting becomes something you can do as easily as receiving a phone call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weblog is not something that any corporation could have initiated although some community sites do make a fairly decent living as commercial ventures. Corporations may be buying some of the popular ones but the idea that people can publish and be heard is something that is going to put pressure on the control the old media has over the decimmation of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to the blog revolution is the communities that spring up to promote them. Whilst most Net users may never encounter them daily once you publish your own blog it becomes fairly normal to read others. As this becomes pervasive, because we all have something to say, the marketing effect this has is tremendous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personal Digital Agents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a bit of dream technology but the fundementals are in place. Personal digital agents are programmatical software that performs tasks for you using artificial intelligence. Whether that is trawling the net for news on a particular product or company, preparing a set of references for an article or locating that elusive school friend they will be tremendous boons and will change the way we do things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agent technology has been in academia for a long time and its slow emergence in the commercial world (mainly in trading applications) is not making too much noise. As part of the Semantic Web agents are something still considered part of an ivory tower dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Agents to be useful they will need to be smart and programmable with the same level of skill it takes to write an Excel macro. They need to be able to do a lot of basic things such as finding things on the Net or on p2p networks without any knowledge on the user part. They must also be able to construct solutions to complex problems with the minimum of fuss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to agent technology will be that they must be multipurpose and built on open standards. Much of the underlying principles are there and there is some progress in making agent development simpler. Yet the technology has a long way to go and it will be sometime before it is ready for even the use of the general technical enthusiast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if it follows the model of other disruptive technologies then it will happen far quicker than anyone expected and it will present us with a new world of opportunities and open up a whole new set of dilemas for the business world.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 15:46:31','2015-03-05 15:48:26',1,'disruptive-influences','7c816eb6-9f52-45e0-adc7-3707a824018a',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2002-06-28 19:47:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(20,'Article','Separation of Concerns','monkeyx','<p>Separation of Concerns (SoC): That''s the phrase of the day at work as I make a push for a neater, manageable architecture for our software.

For instance, the documentation uses the \"Separation of Concerns\" pattern to make the documents comprehensible (we have separate documents for Developers, Administrators, and Block Implementers). The documents also use the pattern with XML and XSL so that the look is separated from the content. Either can change without breaking the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article is intended for software architects, project managers and developers. So if you''re not into software development, look away now.</p>\r','\r\n<p>SoC is important because I believe&nbsp;most&nbsp;software is developed in a changing environment where costs for staff is not evenly distributed, the complexity of problems is always increasing and the cost of change is therefore inflationary over time as well as scope. The cost of changing a bug after a day from the code being written is much cheaper than fixing the same bug a month after the software has been released. Changing a website''s look and feel (say a particular button) is cheaper than changing the way it handles e-Commerce payments. An hour''s time of your best Java or C programmer is going to cost a lot more than the same time from your junior web designer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In web environments, one of the most fundamental patterns for development is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern which goes a little towards this by providing separation between the presentation, workflow and business logic. Presentation logic determines how information is displayed to the user; workflow logic determines how the user navigates through the system and business logic is how the system performs the function the user expects of it, e.g. buying a widget or checking your account balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MVC only goes so far however and doesn''t solve some major issues in most systems that employ it. How do you utilise a varied skills base on a complex project and ensure your cost/change vs. time graph remains as linear as possible? This is the fundamental issue to the long-term costs of software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in our web environment example, we can usually identify a number of roles: web page designers, graphic designers, editors / content providers, web programmers and systems programmers plus a whole bunch of tertiary roles such as database administrators, analysts, architects etc. Concentrating on the roles that contribute directly to the application''s implementation getting these people to work cohesively together is a major project management issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, how do you integrate the beautifully standards compliant markup (e.g.&nbsp;XHTML) from your web page designer with your web programmers presentation logic? Or how do you manage changes in the business logic that may have implications on your presentation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obvious answer is to identify these different perspectives and to encapsulate them in a formal architecture. For some people the goal of encapsulation is to minimise or avoid impact from&nbsp;<strong>any</strong>&nbsp;change and this has generated a lot of negative perceptions about the value of encapsulation. Simply put, encapsulation is no good for removing the impact of change and I think using it to do this misses the point and benefits of object oriented approaches. Many new converts to object oriented programming (or cynical perverts which reject it off-hand) mistake encapsulation as some gift to provide permanent coupling between parts of a system. It does not do this and no one who works practically with object oriented techniques believes it can or should do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My approach has always been to see encapsulation as a contract of expected behaviour but like any contract or expectation it can be changed and is not immutable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the real benefit of encapsulation is the same as a written contract: When things change, you have to be notified and you have to agree to the change. It makes change explicit and your role in accepting it active rather than having a situation where change can be done implicitly and your role is oftent to passively accept it with unintended side-effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To return once more to the web environment example, one way to manage the multiple skills and to help change management is to use technologies and methodologies that institutionalise separation of concerns. For example, use of resource bundles or their equivalent to encapsulate content from mark-up not only makes internationalisation and localisation more manageable but can help encapsulate changes in content from changes in presentation and vice versa. Likewise, use of&nbsp;CSS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>can separate layout / look-and-feel development from presentation logic. None of these technologies protect you wholesale from the impact of change from one area to another but they allow parallel development to take place and reduce the risks that arises from parallelism. It should be noted that like any parallel process there are communication overheads. Like most decisions in technology you have to make the choice on which trade-offs you wish to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two areas that merit particular mention as needing to be separated from the rest of the application is security and transaction management. Security is a big area and is probably the most expensive part of a system to change if it is not separated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Security covers identity, authentication, authorisation, encrypted communication and encrypted data storage as well as many management issues in a typical setup. Most systems today tightly couple security within the application thus changing the logical model of security is incredibly expensive. Imagine for example in a web environment the cost of changing the user model or authentication (login) process. Security is also the least planned part of a system often with the focus on particular areas skewered in the wrong direction. I''ve seen many systems where the project focuses squarely on securing communication or data storage but not on the manageability of the security model. Security in most systems scales poorly with business growth and often puts a ceiling on the extensibility of the software because at some point it becomes perceived the costs of implementing a better security model on an existing application is higher than rewriting a more secure application. I tend to think that unless you''re working on a Microsoft application, you''re unlike to actually hit such a&nbsp;physical&nbsp;barrier but the psychological barrier is far easier breached depending on the character of the staff you have working for you. I''m as guilty as anyone of weighing up a choice between a hideous, overcomplicated refactoring job and preferring a fresh start despite of the risks associated with a clean start. The psychological barrier for security related issues is particularly high because security code is usually fairly obtuse in comparison to other code. It is also the area where in-house code shows, putting it kindly, a lot of \"individualism\" which makes change by anyone but the original developers difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So encapsulating all security issues away from the main application code is an important ingredient to a long shelf-life for a system. Java is particularly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>good at providing the right standards to enables this such as&nbsp;JAAS&nbsp;and&nbsp;JCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transaction management is again another area where&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030401224718/http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2001/04/26/j2ee.html\">Java does very well</a>&nbsp;and in fact most of value of things likeEJBs&nbsp;is in the transparent (container) managed transaction handling. Even simpler systems that don''t run on heavy-weight middleware like&nbsp;J2EE&nbsp;middleware it still makes sense to encapsulate transactions away from the business logic of your application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, separation of concerns is the only way to ensure your software project will be extensible and you can manage the costs of change with a varied skill force. Unless you''re writing trivial code or have a very small, extremely competent, multi-disciplinary team (say of 1-4 developers) you''re going to need to formalise the separation and use technologies that enable you to do this. For project managers, if you''re planning the long-term viability and cost of your project you''re pretty much doomed to incur massive costs and delays&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;the project is even released if you don''t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those familiar with SoC already consider reading&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030401224718/http://www.research.ibm.com/hyperspace/\">Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns: Software Engineering</a>&nbsp;which introduces&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030401224718/http://www.research.ibm.com/hyperspace/GuideToHyperspace.htm\">Hyperspaces</a>, IBM''s approach backed by Hyper/J Java toolkit.</p>\r\n',NULL,'2015-03-05 15:49:26','2015-03-05 15:51:10',1,'separation-of-concerns','54e9dbd3-adc7-49c5-9654-1953bef50842',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-02-03 20:50:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(21,'Article','The Net of a Million Lies','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Awhile back I read Vernor Vinge''s&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020927175902/http://dannyreviews.com/h/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep.html\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">\"A Fire Upon the Deep\"</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;and amongst the plethora of insightful futurology he described a network information source not dissimilar to today''s Internet (or more accurately Usenet).

The way to examine the \"truth\" of a blog piece is to examine the authority with which it speaks. Authority is either earned through renknown and respect based on \"real\" achievements or it is syphoned off other greater authorities. Or it is based on sound scientific principles: good mathematics and repeatable experiments. This latter form of evidence is notable for its absence in most of the Net''s chattering (including here). The higher authority principle, a link to a trustworthy news source, is the most common form of building trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it is no surprise a position based on several advocacy sites, who are in turn based on sites with political agendas, leads to a distorted untruthful caricature of reality.

There just weren''t enough blogs to have really unequal distributions.

How many of the weblogs he mentions have you heard of? I found that most of them were strange to me. So if we''re hitting a scaling wall, why are these blogs becoming popular, even dominant, without any of us knowing about them? If we were all on a mail list together, believe me, we''d know the names of the people who dominate.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030210192242/http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/02/10/are_2d_power_law_graphs_the_way_to_look_at_weblogs.html\">Joi Ito</a>&nbsp;expands on this thought:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Blogs are different. Although the search engines and metaindexes are useful, they are no longer the first place you go. I read my RSS news feeds before I go searching on a portal for news. As Dave says, don''t know most of the blogs on the top 100 list and I don''t care. We are organized into more intelligent communities and although there is a power law of sorts with respect to blogs that get a lot of attention, there are many local peaks. I think it looks much more like clusters of blogs with interconnections between communities. A lot like a strength of weak ties sort of map.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>For what''s worth, I''m also sceptical about the prognosis made by Shirky (and agreed in broader terms by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030210192242/http://www.smalla.net/infofeed/2003/02/08/power_laws_weblogs_and_inequality.shtml\">others</a>), I wrote to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030210192242/http://weblogs.co.uk/ukb/\">ukbloggers</a>&nbsp;mailing list:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Insightful stuff but I wonder how predicative this is in the long-term. Most power-law distribution models I''ve seen are fairly static, that is to say that the environment where they apply are subject to few major disruptions. In a car traffic model, it''s rare for the cars to sprout wings and fly. I''m not sure the web environment is like that over a long period of time or at least there is so little long-term data to suggest it. Change on the web is revolutionary when it comes.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, consider community portals such as Slashdot etc. Did traffic on the Web follow this distribution model with places like Slashdot at the head of the pack? But then what happened when the new personal publishing format (i.e. blogs) came along? How was the distribution changed? Probably just spread out thinner as Chris suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, what affect did the dot com busts have? Or what about new entrants from the mass media? Do these things just stretch the distribution points whilst preserving the model?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems to me that whilst we have a fairly interesting model of traffic and a lot of good philosophical conjecture about what that means we are basing it on a very limited set of data over a short period of time. All on a medium that is susceptible to massive change and disruption. Are we then forcing a model on something where it just doesn''t apply long-term?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a tangent: In human social networks I have read that when the population is too extensive it splits into smaller fenced networks because the management costs of such large networks is higher than the perceived benefits. Whilst egalitarianism may be mathematically impossible (and some would argue contrary to the result of a more perfect system), when it is lacking it is an incentive for most humans to reorganise the system into something which is more \"fair\". This reorganisation is destructive but has arguably long-term benefits. In this context, I''m talking off-line human networks (i.e. nations) but would the same apply to the Internet? Or is this less a social network or even a human one?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of questions in there but perhaps I can expand on this thought a little here. I''m firmly of the mind that human social networks self-destruct the further the distribution of resources spreads unevenly. The more inherent ''unfairness'' creeps into the system the greater number of dissatisfied members of the network. No matter how efficient the system nor how much the value the system generates over time if there are increasingly more \"have nots\" then those who monopolise resources the friction in the system will reach a breaking point. In this regard, I''m fairly opposed to economic reasoning of capitalism''s \"trickle down effect\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, in human networks I would say such a distribution and friction is an established factor of the social structure. It is unavoidable, no matter how good the system, no matter how well organised nor how well intentioned or ideologically pure. The measure of a system is how well it scales with these problems and for how long. In terms of human politics democracy and capitalism scale the best but they are not going to scale indefinitely. Totalitarianism and forms of fascism scale the least well in practice because they divert too many resources towards conflict and control. Communism scales slightly better because corruption is more widely spread and it more easily placates the low-end of the distribution spread. Theocracies are similar in this regard. However, ultimately their weaknesses in effectively holding back the top-end of the distribution (i.e. the entreprenuers and the rich) causes a friction that when coupled with a lot of external pressure causes the system to fail. In isolated and poorly connected scenarios such models are far better at scaling over time even when they hamper innovation. As an example, I would present Christiandom prior to the Lutherian revolts, Industrial revolution and such that marks the culmination of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Enlightenment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving from socio-economic systems to command structures I see the rise of nationalism as the result of the friction that arises when empires become overstretched. Nationalism is a product of human desire for egality within the system or more appropriately better representation for themselves (often at the expense of others). Empires are notioriously inefficient at spreading the benefits across the board and may well follow a power-law distiribution in terms of wealth and social justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, some people argue that the point of failure for large social structures is one of poor communication and that with today''s communication technology empires can expand across the globe without the traditional constraints. I find this reasoning flawed because it assumes the problem is a technological one not a human one. Fundementally, no matter how effective the communication channel people will not feel ownership of something so far removed from them. This in turn leads to friction which can impede or reverse harmonisation efforts, no matter how high minded. As a case in point I would present the European Union where even in countries driving the system there is a lot of scepticism, uncertainty and occasional hostility amongst those which benefit most from it. The United States perhaps is a counter-example but here we have a fairly cohesive culture and a dominant ethnicity which has until very recently in its history successfully repressed other ethnic groups. Even today, the US is incredibly biased in favour of one ethnic group at the expense of the others despite high-minded ideals and progressive legislation. If the riots of LA and growing problems with drugs and violence are any indicators this friction is still evident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, this leads me to the web which is where all this thinking started. Shirky''s analysis I think misses the point, which is perhaps that which Winer is making, that human social networks counteract ''unfairness'' in the system by branching away and imposing a new system where egality can be re-established. The friction of community portals / lists / boards and a sense of personal identity are perhaps a root cause of why blogs exist at all. After all why incur the additional cost of running a personal site when there are perfectly functional services available for self-expression?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way, I see that weblog traffic distribution follows Shirky''s analysis at the macro level, it is not an immutable or even relevant model for the future. The friction of a few dominant broadcasters versus a large number of conversationists will increase until a new form of communication will establish in an attempt to reorder things in their favour. People will innovate their way out of the low-traffic end of the distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most such reorganisation efforts in the human world this will be initially destructive and will probably reassert itself back to the same model over time. However, I see this destructive process as essential for progress because static models of distribution eventually lead to decadence and decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One last thought before I''m done: Is the web a good model for the issues of large scale infrastructures? My guess would be to say it is because (and inspite of) its fluid curve in change and innovation. Like all software systems, it is more malleable than hardware and can better represent in a shorter period how change effects established systems and what its consequences can be. The issues arising in web infrastructure have parallels in the off-line world because it is a representation of the human mind. In fact, it may be the ultimate expression of the human condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Stefan''s comments prompted me to provide even more of an explanation and to follow some tangents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also as evidence that human networks try to address the arising inequality&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030210192242/http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/interestingnewcomers.html\">check this out</a>&nbsp;(from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030210192242/http://boingboing.net/2003_02_01_archive.html#90301663\">Boing Boing</a>).</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 16:37:23','2015-03-05 16:39:54',1,'egality-and-power-law-distributions','cd3c4ca8-9042-4f3d-ac09-d1a32ae6f536',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2002-02-20 21:39:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(23,'Article','Space Exploration','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The Columbia tragedy has helped focus debate on the purpose and benefits of manned space exploration and there''s been a lot written on the subject.

Fate and faith may be inspirational but they offer little to science and usually infer poor policy. Fatalism is a failure of the human imagination to see plurarilism in the future. If it were fated that mankind is to become a space faring race, despite the total lack of precedence, then a solid game strategy would not involve active participation in accomplishing that fate. In any model with predetermination the rational approach is to aim at other ancilliary objectives. So if space is man''s destiny, humankind should aim towards something else that is perhaps not our destiny. For example, world peace, the elimination of poverty and disease. After all, these are fairly unlikely outcomes for human kind, right? So let''s bin the whole \"destiny\" aspect of the discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let''s judge space exploration, manned or not, on the merits of itself rather than our irrational desire to flee the problems we face today. It is my experience that whenever we flee problems caused by human character we simply take it with us as a seed for future disharmony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\"I wanna be a space man!\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our culture is flooded with imagery of space exploration as a noble pursuit, a higher purpose or a closeness with the divine. It is not surprising the mythos surrounding space travel has so ingrained itself in the fabric of any imaginative soul. I too want to \"go boldy where no man has gone before\" and the rest. However, the reality is that likelihood is nonexistent for nearly all of us. We''ve been overly optimistic about the likelihood of space colonies or any exodus beyond this blue sphere and this illusion we feed ourselves is perhaps a psychological crutch against the difficulties on the path we''re walking on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\"Let''s commercialise space\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realising this we''ve turned to another crutch of the human imagination: Private enterprise holds the answer. It is true determined trailblazers and the dangling carrot of profit can be powerful driving forces. It is also true, if not universally, that private organisations are better at channeling funds into getting immediate feedback. However, the mistake in this solution I think lies in assuming the incremental gains of private enterprise in the field of technology will overcome the occasional leaps required by a state sponsored drive towards tangible objectives. The late 20th Century is littered with examples of such leaps made on the back of defence spending. Given where we are now in space travel I don''t hold out much hope that commercial aspirations will bring us the required leaps before space travel is a bankable commodity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate driving force for commerce is profit. If you exlude philanthropy where money is poured in by the rich dreamers who know the chance of any return is less than marginal, you are left with few commercial interests being served by space travel. We''ve cornered one: commercial satellites. The other being low-orbital tourism which I suspect will be the final destiny of the International Space Station (ISS). Perhaps Hilton will build its space hotel and charge millionaires extortionate rates for a piece of vanity. It may even broaden a few minds and national lotteries could offer the opportunity to the less privelaged. Opportunities abound in this field but this is not space travel. Whilst it remains stuck in orbit over the Earth it will also be highly restrictive. Building hotels in space as opposed on planetary surfaces may offer some unique advantages (e.g. zero-g, cheaper docking) but is not something that can scale to reach the levels of mass tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\"Space exploration as R&amp;D\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is clearly much innovation involved in putting men on the Moon or Mars but the limited scientific benefits of orbital travel means our focus has been too narrow to merit the expensive price of the Shuttle or ISS. State sponsored science works best in two-ways: distributing funds and fulfilling impossible ambitions. The former is the way that much of American (and other) military research programmes work with the exclusion of NASA. The last is used on occasions such as the Apollo or Manhattan projects. If its wonders of the world we wish to build let''s aim towards them. It doesn''t matter if the project doesn''t offer immediate returns because the shear drive to meet its purpose offers numerous benefits. It is the focused energy that is important. The data accrued and the innovations made will feed themselves back into the ''real world'' quickly enough. Without this aim, however, NASA is a sinkhole for funds that could be better allocated for much higher returns on non-manned space research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\"My space programme is bigger than yours\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presige of the space programme is how NASA has managed to become such a bloated, poorly focused yet highly competent organisation. Some people draw the conclusion that we should in fact encourage man''s propensity for pointless territorial aspirations.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030216165513/http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/004456.html#4456\">Nick Denton</a>&nbsp;argues for militarising space and letting territorial greed drive humanity to space. In this perspective, the crowing emotions of the 1960s space race can be revived. It basically reduces a matter of science to a test of masculinity. It''s all about dick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick''s good at giving simplistic, seemingly obvious witty solutions to complex issues by tapping into the human psyche. He''s of the \"it''s common sense\" school of journalism and therefore highly entertaining to read but rarely holds much water under any sort of scrutiny. Let''s ignore the obvious flaw in promoting conflict in space or generally as a solution to anything (the eugenics inspired model of human behaviour). Let''s also ignore the trend until recently in the world towards harmonising relations and putting aside national differences in the pursuit of commercially-driven prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If space was to be territorialised or space programmes to be symbols of prestige they have to offer tangible benefits as well as propaganda. Building Pyramids teach you a lot about mathematics, astronomy, medicine, management and produce countless other worthwhile by-products. It also puts a mark on the sand saying \"We were here\". But in the end it does you no good if that''s all you end up doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Claiming territory is the same. The Frontier mentality so romanticised by Americans wouldn''t mean jack if the Frontier doesn''t offer something worth having. The Americas, the greatest story of property theft in history, offered frontiers but with a purpose and a lot of value. Space in contrast is fairly desolate and its acquistion at present pointless. Immigrants to the Americas came looking not for hardship but sweet times. Sure they worked hard, suffered some, innovated some and killed a lot but they did it so they could own rich land suitable for agricultural development. Claiming a bit of the moon only offers something to a real frontiersperson if there is something valuable on that desolate rock which makes the effort worth it. At this time there is nothing worth claiming in space except possibly the oribit of Earth for military defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pissing contests between nations are like international sports events: a form of conflict resolution and brinksmanship. They are power conflicts that can break down to economic collapse, war or disappointing détente. It ruined Europe in 1914, the Soviet Union in the 1990s and it could ruin the US. The notion that the US has some divine manifest for glory is an indication of how sick it has become, how far removed from the enterprising history and humanist ideals which made it. Nationalistic but meaningless programmes are the worst form of rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\"One step for man, one giant leap for mankind\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst all the national insecurities and half-baked solutions there is one thing that seems to be overlooked by American''s without much thought. Space travel is a unifier. Space travel is great publicity for endearing yourself to a world population that has become distrustful of your abuses of power. If hearts are to be won, it will not be greedy corporations or militarism that will do it. It will be generosity of spirit and the pursuit of a higher purpose. To seek life on other planets. To go where no man has gone before. To bring together the nations of this world under a common cause. NASA does this superbly but needs to aim higher. It needs to attempt the impossible not the routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ISS once symbolised that but geopolitics has interfered and a searching for justifications has ensued. Fatalism has encroached our assesment of our future. Uncertainty and mistrust have spread. NASA could remedy that. It could illustrate to the world America isn''t merely crass culture, consumerism and vanity. There are few remaining symbols of American optimism and their good natures left. Promote NASA not just on the national scene as a symbol of hope but do it internationally. In fact, transform it to a global agency.

It''s one I''ve heard a good number of times and it''s one that holds the most water. It basically boils down to the fact that sure the US hasn''t handled this crisis well, sure it has a dubious number of motives and a thin veil of deception on a number of tangential issues but the price of letting Saddam off the hook would be too great. Therefore, if the choice is between leaving a homicidal dictator in place or putting faith in the US ability to build a democratic Iraq that will improve the future of Iraqi people (and lift their source of long-suffering: sanctions) we must support the US.</p>\r','\r\n<p>Should a war actually break out it would be hard for most of the anti-war movement to want anything but American success. The alternative is far too bleak a thought: a war-torn Iraq still under the grip of Saddam. Of course, realistically this isn''t going to be much of an issue. The US will of course win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the choice is always presented as a lesser of two evils and it has played out in such a way that it has become the only choice. We''ve been railroaded into a position where we can''t possibly withdraw nor can the leaders who''ve pushed this so far do so without their political futures becoming untennable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what we''re asked to do is to make-believe the American government will turn Iraq into a democratic paradise. We''re supposed to ignore the dubiousness of their motives and we''re supposed to swallow the half-truths they spread in pushing their agenda. We''re also supposed to ignore history and the wide ranging arguments that are presented cogently against war. We''re supposed to do this because the alternative is so much worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This seems to be a pragamtic approach. However, I''ve heard this line of logic so many times from dictatorial regimes that I''m surprised people in a demcoracy are so willing to accept it. In accepting the narrow choices offered today means the next time the same choices are presented to us we will be just as powerless. They will always be able to frame the debate in this manner by taking actions that makes the debate irrelevant and the democratic institutions we''ve built equally irrelevant. The harvesting of a crisis to the point where there is no other alternative path to the one that the government had already decided to pursue months before the ''debate'' even began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next time will come with Iran I suspect and for this reason I''m most apprehensive about the precedence this will set and about the strategic implications of a massive US military presence in the region. The promises of democracy will die with this presence because you''ll never have acceptance in this region of such a military occupation. The impact will be a rise in terrorism and a security clampdown to preserve the peace. The more the US tries to stablise the region through force, the more it will have to spread its base. After Iran it can assert its direct authority on the already occupied and nominally friendly Guld States. A collapse of the military junta in Pakistan could mean the same fate lies for that country too. Thus an empire will be built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pro-war brigade and their appeasers like to take the moral highground, ignoring the immorality of the natural murder constituted by this war, and call for steeled hearts for the greater good. They like to talk about the cowardice of any who stand against the war and dismiss opposition by caricatures of selfishness, weakness and stupidity. In the end, they lack the courage to face internal turmoil and poor economies in the path for peace. They are not willing to see beyond the simplistic reasoning which portrays this war as some morality play with Bush the Good fighting Saddam the Evil. More importantly they seem to be unwilling to look at this game of realpolitiks beyond the first few opening moves and seem to ignore all the relevant precedence to this scenario in favour of the glamour of by-gone history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the eve of this war any rational, patriotic individual with a modest sense of humanity must always be prepared to stand against poorly advised policy. If the case for war or the plans for the future of Iraq seem empty of all but evangelical rhetoric then complying is cowardice instituted by fear. If our governments are not made fully accountable and transparent in their reasoning for this conflict each subsequent point for our assessment will become more and more irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I stand as much opposed to this war as ever and despite the fact I see it as unstoppable and inevitable I am glad to make this stand. My conscience would not be clear if I had not. I have seen war up close and it needs more justification then this. In the end will those who support this war or ambivelant about it able to take personal responsibility for the deaths that ensue? Will you be able to look at the dead Iraqi men, women, and children and say, \"Ahh, it was worth it. Today was a good for peace and democracy.\" Of course, most won''t have to - they''ll be spared the imagery and barbarity of war. In twelve months it will all be forgotten in favour of other stories. For those of us who grew up amidst war, these are not images you ever forget. Nor forgive.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 16:58:07','2015-03-05 17:01:02',1,'a-convincing-argument-for-war','ba7b9c05-f0e1-4af2-9649-0008b5d1e393',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-02-16 22:00:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(25,'Article','Viva La Difference!','monkeyx','<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030320032153/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2053823.stm\">Jack Straw</a>&nbsp;further insulted the French for their ''intransigence'' on saying that they will veto a second UN resolution which has started a flurry of political activity in the UK. Moving swiftly on from the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030320032153/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2842463.stm\">calculated kick</a>&nbsp;received from our ally to the traditional frog bashing is a calculated move designed to offer a substitute for the British public''s scepticism of American policy.</p>\r\n\r','\r\n\r\n<p>There must be something in the Anglosaxon character which instinctively dislike something in the French. Perhaps, it is the intellectualism which is interpreted as snobby and pretentious. Perhaps it is a history of bad blood and conflict over interests in Europe. Perhaps it is French stubborness to adopt English en-masse or accept Americanisation quietly like the rest of the world. I''m not entirely certain and for this I think I''m most resolutely lacking a deep understanding of the English character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paradox as usual with these things is how interwined British and French lives are and how similar from an outsider they are. Whether it''s their obsession in maintaining rural values in an urbanised world or the reminders of an imperial past littered throughout their respective terrains, there are obviously many similarities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure the British didn''t know how to cook before but they sure know how to eat. Thus it was a marriage made in heaven. Fine British meats with quality French sauces. Yummy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The differences are certainly evident. The French are perhaps more pervasively cultured. The British have quality newspapers, writers, film makers and so on. Yet the masses are more likely to watch soap operas than political debates, more likely to visit a cinema to see a Hollywood film than to visit a theatre. When going to the theatre it seems well-tested musicals are more appealing than experimental, confrontational or intellectual plays. Alcohol<strong>consumption</strong>&nbsp;in Britain versus social drinking in France. The list goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are British and Americans who don''t fit the mass culture that is pulsing across the Atlantic who more closely mirror their French cousins in tastes, attitudes and lifestyle. France is the refuge of the radical and French cultural influence the solace of the Anglosaxon intellectual. It is no wonder why ordinary British and American folks despise the French so. There are so many ways in English to deride the intelligent or at least overtly smart (ass).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fundementally, I find the difference in British / American and French culture revolves around a couple of central points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the French are intellectual wannabes. They adore anything that is unusual, challenging, loopy, surreal, complex, and increasingly, as foreign from the norms of an Anglicised world as possible. The British by contrast are far more rooted in the mundane. Fancy thoughts and flights of fantasy are frowned upon. Practicality, simplicity, moral certainty are virtues. Eccentricity has a place but unless it is self-destructive their is fear. An eccentric drunk is most welcome in British culture. An outspoken writer not so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, the role of authority is perceived very differently. In trying to express this I would say authority in the British mind is a top-down affair whilst for the French it seems to be derived from the center. Authority is ancestral in the British (and American) culture where as the French seem to have a more meritorious approach to authority based on a binding, shared perception of what is to be valued. The French seem to push the points of authority in their society to the edges of local respectability where as the British push authority up organisations that are as far removed from their own daily lives as possible. The French are not afraid of distributing power whereas the British seem to be glad to have others worry about such matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difficulty of being an outsider watching siblings quarrel is you tend to rationalise a lot of ambigious information into something tangible and probably incorrect. Hence, my no doubt poor analysis. I find that whilst I know what the argument is about, I find the reactions of both parties somewhat baffling. It''s like watching the body language of two strangers whilst they conduct a conversation and trying to understand what is&nbsp;really&nbsp;going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, you can blame all this pontificating on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030320032153/http://www.idlewords.com/\">Maciej</a>&nbsp;whose hosting a ''French week'' on his and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030320032153/http://www.nobodysdoll.com/\">his better half''s</a>site.

You have to open your eyes to the simpler charms of foreign lands and the ancient, proud history of a people. You have to speak their language, not just the words but the understanding that goes with those words. You have to be genuinely interested in listening to the people, of absorbing their thoughts and make them a part of your own.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a trained soldier, fed a diet of confident superiority in their own culture and values, is expected to be the tool by which hearts and minds are won then you''ve already lost. Sure, there may be specialists and in the long run civilians who can do this job but the first contact leaves a lasting impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the war gets dirtier, and I believe it will, the American troops will rashly retaliate at the wrong targets for fear of their lives. It is a natural inclination of any normal human being in the face of great dangers. However, from such actions are blood enemies born. Restraint is paramount and evident in the top-level plans which we see playing out on the news. However, restraint in the towns and on the ground by troops will be difficult to maintain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not a unique failing of the American character, although it is most evident when they are seen in combat. It is no surprise the British troops, generally far more skilled at these measures, are used to clean up the population centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Winning this war will be more difficult than previously thought. Not on the grand plains of military strategies but on the street and homes of all those affected by it. Once, the war is won, winning the peace will be a monumental task. How large a task will depend on the efforts during wartime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not merely a matter of economics, the flow of capital, the reconstruction of infrastructure or the proper sales of Iraq''s natural resources. It is a function of how sensitively and with what humility the peace is managed. Historically, American forces have been extremely poor in this regard and this requires a United Nations presence. However, until the handover is completed I expect Iraqi hearts and minds will foremost be thankful for the death of the dictator but secondly wary of the foreigners who hold them, their culture and their way of life in such disregard.</p>\r\n',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:03:21','2015-03-05 17:05:27',1,'the-battle-for-hearts-and-minds-of-iraq','f939ee12-3da6-49bd-8d98-8430b5503637',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-03-26 22:04:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(27,'Article','Code Monkeys','monkeyx','<p>One of the joys of not being employed by someone else and working on your&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030526182245/http://www.blogshares.com/\">own software</a>&nbsp;is it lets you experiment with your working patterns, toolset and communication channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030526182245/http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030514.html#125219\">Russell</a>&nbsp;is going through the same thing:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Here''s a thought: because I have no net during the day and thus doing my development offline, I actually feel more productive because there''s no distractions. No email, no aggregators, no browsing when bored, no IMing, etc. It really allows total concentration. These things of course also have their downside - no email makes me feel out of touch. No aggregator ditto. No browsing means that I can''t quickly look something up on Google when I run into a problem and no IMing means I can''t tap someone''s expertise when I need it either. Not having Google is especially rough... Correct me if I''m wrong, but I''d say that in a modern developer''s virtual toolkit, Google is #2 right after a decent IDE in terms of necessity. I''ve just recently started using IM for development as well - last month I cried out for help and included my IM names and 30(!!) people responded and now if I have a question about a variety of topics from User Interface Design to Cocoon I''ve got an expert online to tap when I need it.

The first role has been to codify what is already common practice in the industry. Such standards are attempts to capture what everyone is already doing, perhaps ironing out some minor inconsistencies along the way. But such a standards effort is at base a descriptive one. The original IP standard was such a beast; so was the ANSI C standard. Neither attempted to invent much of anything; both simply tried to make clear what everyone was already using. The standards being described were already de facto standards; writing them down was a documentation job that either got it right or missed the mark.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r','\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>This is very different from a standards effort that attempts to invent the standard from the ground up. Such a standards effort is not descriptive, but rather an attempt to invent by committee. There is no common practice to describe; instead the standards group is trying to tell everyone what they should be doing in the future. The ANSI C++ committee, which started out as a descriptive body, became one of these sorts of standards groups when it was decided that they should \"improve\" the language. Many of the Object Management Group (OMG) Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Common Services groups were this sort of standards body. There are lots of others around now; I''m sure you can name many of them so I won''t. These are the de jure standards groups, and they are the ruin of our industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those of you who have been part of a de jure standard effort know what I mean when I say that they turn all technical questions into political ones. Discussions may appear to center around the technology, but the real decisions are made either in setting up the requirements (beware the use case, my son) or in meetings outside of the general discussions between subsets of the committee who trade votes like Chicago precinct bosses. The ultimate threat in such organizations is that some of the founding (or important) members will split off and start a competing standards group, which seems to be happening on a weekly basis in some of these discussions. The real goal in all of this, of course, is to get your competitors to (unknowingly) agree to some approach to technology that you and your company already have in a product (either shipping or ready to go). Then what would otherwise be proprietary can now be seen as an \"open\" standard. Just an open standard that only you have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Many new standards in computing today are rushed to the marketplace before the practical applications are tested, the domain matured or even when the need for interoperability has not been testified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Java environment is particularly guilty of this with the J2EE specs looking more and more like a cartel''s dogmatic pursuit to lock out potential competitors by raising the standards bar. I personally like EJBs as a mechanism for object oriented, meta-data based transaction handling. In a large scale enterprise, its object pooling is a great boon depending on the underlying implementation. I like the portability offered by having both the transaction model and the pooling model transportable between vendors. However, as a persistence model or a distributed object model the standards have made it next to useless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By locking in customers into a high-performance, industrial strength solution and pushing that for all cases, the J2EE environment becomes a series of missteps for its potential clients who turn away from the ever bloated big vendor offerings for smarter, tailored solutions which are not driven by these standards pushed on us by Sun, IBM, BEA and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me standards offer two simple rewards for a lot of horse trading and technical limitations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. They codify existing best practices to enable new entrants and existing participants to leverage the collective sum of industry expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. They further interoperability by allowing all parties to work to a common specification</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If either of these factors are missing from the drive to create a standard, it is generally a failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where I disagree with Jim is that I don''t see standards as the ruin of our industry. They''re just specs and like any specs we are free to abandon them when they no longer suit our purposes. Microsoft does this all the time and I applaud them. They use the weakness of standards to their benefit and where it not for their illegal activities as far as their monopoly position goes, they would be right to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not everybody has the power in the market to disobey unworkable standards and the price for poor standards get amplified but it''s a learning exercise and it doesn''t seem like the greatest harm done to our industry.

So its shape and fortunes very much effect things over here and the things do not look good over in the world''s hyperpower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030621032836/http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2003/05/19.html#a366\">Scott Rosenberg</a>&nbsp;surveys the landscape:</p>\r','\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The optimists have the following arguments in their favor: The economy is inherently cyclical, and sooner or later -- well, by now, \"later\" is the only possibility -- this downturn must end. And the Fed''s low interest rate policy and the Bush tax cuts (whatever their long-term cost in deficits and Social Security insecurity) provide plenty of anti-recession firepower. Just as the pain of the early ''80s preceded a rest-of-the-decade boom -- and, for that matter, the pain of the early ''90s did the same -- so we too can expect the sun to start shining any day now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pessimists survey the scene and point out that our situation today is inherently different from previous cyclical downturns. In the past, we''ve started with an inflationary trend; the Fed tightened interest rates, plunging the economy into recession but laying the groundwork for new growth as companies learned to do more with less. Today, inflation is dead, interest rates are rock-bottom and the economy is still stalled. The Fed worries about deflation, a threat unknown since the 1930s. And the very fact that nobody is sure what''s going on has a further dampening effect. Meanwhile, the Bush administration''s muddled \"Cut taxes now, let our kids pick up the tab\" approach is not instilling confidence in business or consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pessimist, then, views the present economy not as a repeat of the early-''80s or early-''90s style business cycle but as something more akin to the mid-''70s \"stagflation\" -- an anomalous era when we suffered from both inflation and recession at the same time (something that economics orthodoxy insisted was highly unlikely but that those of us who lived through it remember quite vividly). This variety of cycle -- the kind of fundamentally out-of-kilter global economy seen in the 1930s and 1970s -- is not a two-to-three-year phenomenon; it''s more like a decade-long trauma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My heart wants to be an optimist here, but my head is definitely feeling pessimistic.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I''ve not lived long enough to appreciate a prolonged downturn like that of the 1970s or the disastrous 1930s. I started working as the economy and political scene here in the UK was at a bright point after a devisive near-two decades under Tory rule. Labour weren''t in power then and the Internet bubble had room to expand before exploding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I dropped out of Uni to pursue a host of opportunities which were more appealing than the insurmountable debt and tired courses. It was a glorious few years and despite all the mistakes along the way I think it will now be a highlight of my employment history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn''t the fact I had choices in employment nor the fact I advanced fairly quickly up the career ladder to a position that suited me. It wasn''t that new technologies were popping up every other day and everybody was keen to capitalise on the opportunities presented. Much of that still exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I will miss is the blind optimism. I liked the feel good factor of working in an industry which promised to change the world. When AOL tech support staff made millions. When Napster threatened to change the way music was produced and distributed in favour of the consumer. When advertising was going to fund every cool community or information portal that someone dreamt of. When the buzz was I could graduate to the ridicilous perks offered to those in Sillicon Valley. When London wasn''t all financial software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was all fairy dust but it sure beats the mundane career paths on offer to today''s graduates. Now we''re back to being engineers, work horses for hire under heavy fire from much cheaper alternatives abroad. Our opinions and ideas are relegated to the back rooms once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet did change some things. The way I work today and the opportunities it has presented were simply not around 10 years ago. Not for my sort and not in my home. The mundane is no longer the only option for jaded dot com''ers or new graduates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key thing seems to be hold on tight, be prudent with your means and ambitions, position yourself for the eventual up-turn and keep on learning. Our advantage to the generations before has to be our ability to find, absorb and use knowledge. If I can do that until old age, I think the economic cycles will be something I can use not something I need to fear as I would have done had I entered this market today.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:10:56','2015-03-05 17:12:25',1,'what-kind-of-downturn-is-this','6a0c4208-d71c-4e05-bbea-121b19cf6a4b',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-05-19 21:12:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(30,'Article','Science, Environmentalism and Doomsayers','monkeyx','<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030621032836/http://www.davidgalbraith.org/archives/000370.html#000370\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">David Galbraith</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;makes a lot of sense but on this matter whilst I agree with his principals / assumptions, I disagree with his conclusions:</span><br>\r\n</p>\r','\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In case anyone misinterprets the previous post defending Matt Ridley''s attack on those (such as Bill Joy) who see absolute dangers in innovation such as nanotechnology and concludes somehow that I am against environmentalist causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

Evidence suggests that increasingly efficient hunter-gatherers would have continued their extinction of prey species - they had already devastated the fauna of Australia, the Americas and many islands - stopping only when the last tree in the last rain forest was felled. Rees admits in passing that \"the most dramatic engines of current economic growth - miniaturisation and information technology - are environmentally benign\", but then fails to follow this thought.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The \"what if\" scenario of hunter gatherers hunting all lifeforms on this planet to extinction is in itself dubious. If you consider some simple models like the fox and hen scenario where the lack of resources limits growth this hypothesis seems flawed. Now the additional complexities of natural disease or diseases which are the product of pollution (perhaps cancer) and other factors you have a really big assumption that human life without industrialisation would have ended in catastrophe. The case doesn''t seem conclusive and weakens the argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What seems more flawed is the notion that miniaturisation and information technology reduce pollution. I guess Matt Ridley is not aware of the huge amounts of pollution contributed by the computer industry not just in the manufacture of silicon but also in the additional manufacture of plastic encasing etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miniaturisation is also a dubious credit to progress in reducing pollution. The energy costs for miniaturisation processes and the resulting consumer electronics boom (with its all its trappings of producing non-degradable plastic) seems to work against this hypothesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst I''m not sure how pessimistic Bill Joy is in his new book as I have not read it, this easy dismissal by Mr. Ridley doesn''t seem to be anything but sheer, blind optimism in humanities capabilities to innovate its way out of environmental disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all the contrary signals I find that optimism misplaced. If in 200 years we have not done irreparable damage to our environment due to nuclear weapons, genetic engineering or nanotechnology it will not be through misplaced optimism but on active decisions we make today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with the universal generator in nanotechnology and the resulting grey goo problem is one that I haven''t see properly addressed nor the effects of genetic modifications. Given this lack of real measures or solutions, a healthy scepticism and even some measure of pessimism is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:13:20','2015-03-05 17:15:01',1,'science-environmentalism-and-doomsayers','7c20ee88-0375-4198-a3eb-ed32e5a1b61e',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-05-20 21:14:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(31,'Article','America and Iran','monkeyx','<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030621032836/http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1840707\">The Economist</a>&nbsp;this week has a good profile of the issues and recent developments around Iran and American foreign policy related to it.</p>\r','\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>IRANIANS are once again taking to the streets to criticise their clerical rulers. On June 11th and 12th, thousands of people demonstrated in Tehran, the capital, in the biggest anti-establishment protests for several months. The ostensible reason for the unrest is anger at plans to privatise Iran''s colleges, though many of the protesters are frustrated by the slow pace of political and social reform. Police and Islamic militia groups prevented the demonstrators from approaching Tehran university buildings the scene of violent protests four years ago and the government gave warning that â€œillegal activities would not be tolerated. By Friday June 13th, with thousands of riot police on the streets and many roads blocked, the number of demonstrators had fallen back to a few hundred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran''s leaders are blaming America for their latest spot of bother. The Islamic nation''s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who supervises the country from a pedestal of unaccountability, said Washington had been stirring up trouble and encouraging people to take to the streets. Now America itself is openly saying it wants to create disorder inside Iran, he said in a speech broadcast on state television. Their solution is creating disputes among the nation and separating the nation from the system.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>My view on the situation is this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. American legislators know very little about the internals of Iran and there is a danger of too much pressure being applied too quickly by neoconservative elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The EU must stop negotiating a trade deal with the Iranian regime until such times as the theocracy is replaced with a democratic institution or it is clear that human rights are being observed. As it is the EU is playing into the mullahs hands who are using Khatami to pretend there is a reformist element when there clearly is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Russia needs to disengage in providing technology to assist Iran''s nuclear ambitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Iranians (the people) have nothing to win by becoming a nuclear power&nbsp;<strong>at this time</strong>. A democratic Iran may in the future strive for equality on the world stage by possessing such weapons, particularly as Israel is allowed to possess them, but a theocratic tyranny in possession of nuclear weapons would only further estrange Iranian-American relations thus worsening prospects for Iranians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. The United States must not support the Iranian Council of Resistance or the Mujaheeden. No Iranian inside Iran takes them seriously and their crimes against fellow Iranians plus their support of Saddam Hussein who initiated the Iran-Iraq war should be punished. They should have no part in a future democracy until such times as they renounce terrorism and stop killing Iranians. The hypocracy of their current classification and their continued existence in American-occupied Iraq must be ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Likewise the Pahlavi dynasty, a Western puppet monarchy from inception, has no role in a future democratic Iran regardless of the current Prince-in-Exile''s professed Americanisation and supportive views on democracies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. The political assention of Iran will not be achieved overnight and Western spectators should give the country ample time to evolve to take its place amongst the world''s democracies. Rushing this process by force of arms is a sure fire sign that Western intentions are not good because the setback to Iran''s political and economic development will plant the seeds for further cycles of instability, extremism and violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Leadership should come from within the country. Exiles should bring skills, resources and advice but cannot realistically lead a nation they have become estranged from. Any positioning of such emigres within the Iranian political structure by a foreign power will be viewed as the old&nbsp;Great Game&nbsp;being played out by colonial powers like before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Iran''s demographics are both favourable to progress (e.g. a lot of young people) and against it (e.g. a lot of illiteracy). The general apathy of the majority of Iranians towards their political fate is a symptom of over a century of foreign manipulation. Democracy without legitimacy will be short lived and if such a flower is to bloom it must come from the political will of the people. That will has always been present in the educated few and the antipathy of the rural masses can be overcome peacefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Islam will always have a role in Iran and a moderate form of the Islamic Republic is a good bridge between today''s theological tyranny and a future secular market-oriented democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. The best support foreign governments can give to a developing country is to spread the seeds of individual enterprise. Given that governments, such as the Iranian government, usually interfere in this process (e.g. by stealing national assets and controlling aid distribution) dealing with the government is not a valid course of action in the current environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Iran has many burgeoning cottage industries in the field of engineering and information technology which can be supported. Unfortunately, much of it is centered around illegal activity: distribution of materials prohibited by Iran''s Islamic moral guardians or prohibited by international copyright law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ideal solution to changing the demographics of Iran in favour of democraticisation and capitalism is to \"sponsor\" these individual enterprises and channel the growing technical knowledge of Iran''s youth in productive areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Technological leaders have a HUGE role to play in this process and luckily for them they have direct access to Iran''s technically minded youth as evidenced by the huge numbers of Iranian bloggers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of trucking out the US military might at the first politically convenient moment, perhaps Americans will engage in their distant Iranian friends on the Internet and help them develop economically and technologically thus highlighting the superiority of the American Way.</p>\r\n',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:16:16','2015-03-05 17:18:14',1,'america-and-iran','65ab3ffb-e4fe-44a5-8f9f-a5f600e65bdd',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-06-14 21:17:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(32,'Article','Freedom','monkeyx','<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Demonstrations of freedom are often trivial.</span></p>\r\n<p>I spent a month in Berlin before the Wall fell and I went over to the other side often.

Most of them are pleasant images of my family and my childhood but some are grim reminders of what life is like for many people across the world. In the years after the Islamic Revolution there was public displays of the brutality of the brethren who had ordained to be the guardians of my life and country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were not alone in the causes which triggered my families painful migration from our homeland. Yet at that age I remember only the simple pleasure of being able to listen to Micheal Jackson without worry, to be able to watch films without fear and to be at home without worrying unduly that the Republican Guard would come knocking in search of some \"undesired\" element or another. These are the freedoms I cherished at that young age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The freedom I cherished more as I grew was the freedom from the education that they wished to teach me. The freedom to live free of religious brainwashing was a gift from my father, who despite being a very religious person, understood implicitly that faith is not something that is delivered at the barrel of the gun and morality is something you learn by the examples of your parents and family. His gift has enriched my life as much as his self-sacrifice in bringing me into an opportunity filled world where I can grow without constraints imposed by ignorant mullahs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, freedom is a scary thing and what is worse is that sometimes those who take their own freedoms for granted can so easily steal that which you cherish and suffered to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today as I watch my countrymen in Iran struggle to find their voice and their own freedom, it would be ungrateful of me to complain about the weaknesses of the world I inhabit but it would be a disservice to all those who have suffered in the name of freedom if we were to lose the vigilance that guarantees our continued prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Those who expect to reap the blessing of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>- Thomas Paine</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:22:33','2015-03-05 17:24:35',1,'freedom','5a2dba89-f37f-40b4-bf5b-89f69f9d7d1f',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-06-15 21:23:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(33,'Article','Truth, Faith and Uncertainty','monkeyx','<p>It is said that faith cannot exist without doubt and therefore certainty is the opposite of faith for in certainty one believes that all the answers are known, whereas faith requires serious doubts and uncertainties to allow the adoption of ideas despite the sincerest and most profound doubts. Faith without doubt is bigotry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet in the practice of religion, doubt is often given way to truth. If religion is an expression of faith, organised and made formulaic over generations, is it right to say that faith when enshrined in dogma becomes certainty? So is truth and certainty incompatible with faith?</p>\r','\r\n<p>From an outsiders point of view, religious beliefs can often seem so wrapped in a blanket of certainty about the core principals or gospels of the faith that they become synonymous with truth. To an untrained mind, truth and certainty are the same and it is in this certainty that faith is questioned, and for those that lack it, rebuffed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet in the practice of my religion uncertainty is the principal force that propels both the faithful and curious. Those with a predilection for religious beliefs seem not to be the closed minded stereotypes that are often portrayed by intellectual atheists, at least in the majority of cases. Some are truly feebleminded, that in their pursuit of certainties, salvation and hope they swallow any pill that can reach them quickly. Yet most are developed intellects seeking truth via routes that to me appear alien and misguided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an examination of faith I find the most important characteristic to be one of need and an implicit recognition of our own limitations. When faced with the hurdle of understanding concepts that are too taxing or lacking evidence for explanations that seem fundamental to our existence (who am I? why am I here?), we utilise a trait of humanity that has served our species very well: The ability to make do with what knowledge we have. In science and in life we have found that the best available guess is the one that serves our current needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Details are not necessarily important nor are certainties. Does it truly matter that I do not know what will become of me when I die? No, for it is not the knowledge of death that requires faith but the fear of it. Faith is an emotional response to an emotional issue. Faith acts as a crutch and allows me to concentrate on the more pressing issues related to my survival. Humans like all animals are most concerned with their genetic survival. Complex issues that do not require complex solutions to enhance our chances of survival are redundant. Yet our ability to think and our self-awareness makes us face these issues relentlessly. Faith allows us to put make-shift solutions in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can truth and faith co-exist in the same mind? How can certainty be achieved through faith when faith requires doubt?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is in this that I believe we expose our true dilemma about truth and the nature of the human mind. My thoughts, like others I assume, can often be driven in a number of directions and if the reigns of concentration are loose, they can roam freely, unencumbered by purpose. It is fair to say that I can hold conflicting thoughts and ideas at once, nowhere more so in the battle between Id, Ego and Super-Ego as the psychoanalysts would call them or the struggle between the Beast of Man and the Divine Truth. In expressions of animal instinct and moral code this self-conflict is most self-evident and best expresses the power of a trained mind and the weaknesses of a deranged one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essence of truth may be that unlike logic it does not allow a binary choice between right and wrong. This is where the field of fuzzy logic comes and passes somewhat unsatisfactory through the haze by the introduction of probability which is merely another notation for certainty. It is interesting to note even in our attempts to express a plurality of truth we are reduced to finite possibilities which can be expressed in the solid truths of numbers. Of course, mathematics is just a notation, a short-hand for reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is perhaps this simple fact, our inability to express truth in all its fluid, contradictory ways, that indicates the limitations of human cognition and the possibility of higher cognition. Whether that higher cognitive ability is to be found in life or metaphysics I cannot speculate but the boundaries of science have been well expressed by the limitations of mathematics. There is a point at which we cannot cross, not by means of our existing brains and the way they function. It can be argued we are incapable of producing something that could directly work its way to such truth. If perhaps through chaos and evolution we were to indirectly produce such a consciousness it would not surprise me nor would it surprise me that we couldn''t and whether there was an initial design for such plans or not is immaterial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The important point I think is the recognition that truth is a misnomer for what the human mind holds true and in even in the most determined, self-assured person there is an acknowledgement that uncertainty and hence faith have a role to play. It is known that those with pathological personalities are fundamentally unable to see this gap of credibility between what one knows and what is the truth. In that gap there is the need for faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, in acknowledging that faith has a role to play in all but the most broken of human minds, how can one rationally find faith that brings one closer not further away from truth? And what value has truth in the struggle for survival?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps, I should speak solely for myself on this matter rather than delve into unproven generalities. It is clear that for my physical needs I have no need for faith to meet the struggle - in these times I do not face gruelling labour that requires hope nor terrible obstacles that demand salvation. However, it is in these comfortable times that the true missing part of being human surfaces: purpose. Without purpose I am left alone in the cold, listless and aimless in the face of a world that I cannot influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biology and society throw purpose at me in due course, of this I am fairly certain. Children, obligations, social contracts and ultimately the materialism that comes with our need to wrap ourselves in assets of prosperity (both to defend against future misfortune and preserve our social standing thus protecting us from our human predators). It is these things that will push me from the pontificating of youth into the demands of adulthood (for at 25 I still do not feel obligated to be a grown up).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, in the time I have to waste on such matters I find it discomforting to think of life as but a play in which I have a minor role where my obligations are not to myself or some higher purpose but to the species. I am just a probability factor within its overall survival, so insignificant in its success that my existence would be deemed within the margins of errors of an experiment. Yet, this as discussed is a limitation of the human mind - our ability to see truth as probabilities and not as layers of reality all possible, all probable and all non-measurable without an outside perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it is faith that makes me speculate that I am not merely a part of a vast organic machine because doubt makes me wonder if I am. It is faith that will find in any analysis hope and comfort in my existence because I am programmed to want to survive. In this way, my search for truth ends at the borders of my own comfort and will to survive. It takes true genius and artistry to breach those barriers.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:25:50','2015-03-05 17:32:41',1,'truth-faith-and-uncertainty','6a9d9d8f-68ed-4280-b74c-962f58e3a996',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2003-09-11 21:32:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(35,'Article','Life of Pi by Yann Martel','monkeyx','<p>Having read this book over a month ago it feels strange to write about it now but I''ve had it on my mind for quite some time.

Pi''s father, a zookeeper, arranges to sell the animals of his Pondicherry zoo to various institutions. They plan to make their journey by boat dropping off (or exchanging) animals on the way. So the setting is set for a sea disaster involving a wide variety of animals, one of which is the co-star of much of the rest of the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without revealing the many surprises and revelations of a journey filled with much excitement I can safely say that is not what makes this book so marvellous and yet irritating. Irritating in the way sometimes a question gets beneath your skin and needs to be addressed. Or when you are trying to remember the name of a song you''ve been humming to yourself for too long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is structured effectively into three parts. [As I don''t have a copy of the book at hand now I''m not sure if I''m reflecting the logical structure or the narrative structure when I say that.] The first about Pi''s youthful exuberance and quest for an understanding of faith leads us gently through the essence of a multicultural India where Christianity, Hinduism and Islam interwine. For each faith Pi finds himself a mentor and adopts the religion as his. Despite the resulting conflict of a boy who honestly proclaims himself of multiple faiths, the author paints a picture of religious compatibility hidden by poor understanding, something which Pi as a child can overcome with sheer innocence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secularism is not excluded as Pi learns about zoology (from a suitably atheist teacher) and to a lesser extent modern commercialism from his father. One of the memorable aspects of this intertwining of scientific secularism and innocent faith is the disdain with which the author paints agnostics. Atheism in Pi''s world can be accepted as a belief system but those who progress through life by hedging their bets are deemed weak willed fools. Of course, I''m putting it much more starkly then the author whose commentary is often delivered in sharp, funny lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second part of the book there is an account of survival that is never dull but still gives the feeling of being abandoned, cold, alone and lapsing into death when I read it. There were passages which when I read them made me shiver with cold and thirsty they were so gripping and immersive. So vivid and realistic is the narrative, so moving and engaging, you find yourself cheering Pi and becoming despondent at the thought he may not make it through. It becomes impossible to imagine the author letting this talented survivalist die a murky death that seems increasingly inevitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet as this goes on greatly improbable events and good fortune put a nagging doubt in the back of my head. So convincing the depth of facts and so believable the responses, even when they were extraordinary, I could suspend disbelief and not question the author''s ability to weave a believable story. One event nearly pushed me over the edge and whilst still entertained I felt a little cheated by the plot device that seemed clumsily dropped in (this for those who''ve read it involves a French cook). Yet I continued to absorb every delicious word and glad that I did it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see the third part of the book is where I discovered that the narrative itself had been an illusion. I''m not talking about it being true or false, either within the context of the story or in the ''real'' world. I''m talking about the really interesting thing about the book is not within its pages but outside, in us the readers. Because at its end the&nbsp;Life of Pi&nbsp;doesn''t give us an account of a boy''s amazing journey or his faith but it asks us a simple question: What do&nbsp;you&nbsp;believe in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It begins with a choice about which version of truth in the story is more palatable to you. Then it makes you agonise about your decision as you run through the entire story, armed with the revelations at the end. If you''re a person like myself, often pondering such matters, it becomes a loop of cinema where when reversed through each incident, character and speech leap off the film and look directly at you. Each in turn asks you what you believe in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It''s the meta-story that has got me thinking about this book long after the details of Pi''s journey have been buffered out of my mind. The big choice it presents leads to much thinking about why you make the choices you make and more importantly perhaps, what are the consequences of such choices.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:49:31','2015-03-05 17:51:02',1,'life-of-pi-by-yann-martel','286aa27c-366a-4473-ae45-ee4ab5dacf8e',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2004-06-03 21:50:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(36,'Article','If Blog Syndication Formats were done by Physicists...','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">First up I''m&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040619084322/http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/06/why_we_need_ech.shtml#c423\" style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">on record</a><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">&nbsp;of being less than impressed, very early on, with&nbsp;Pie&nbsp;Atom. Then I looked at it from the perspective of blog syndication formats and the idea of a clean room implementation that broke backward compatibility driven by personalities depressed my enthusiasm with the&nbsp;political movement of weblogs. I saw it as a classic sign of fragmentation of a community which I thought was going to break the properietary mould of software development and build on the disruptive influences of the Web that empowered users not corporations.</span></p>\r','\r\n<p>You may think I was nuts for seeing a collaborative effort to produce an open standard as similar to anti-user behaviour by big software / hardware firms trying to lock people into their properietary platform but my rationale was simple: Here was a&nbsp;<strong>working</strong>&nbsp;syndication format, adopted (and&nbsp;<strong>loved</strong>) by thousands of users which was cheap to produce (and understand), flexible and importantly slim being replaced by something dreamt by a handful of technologists with some (to me) egotistical notion that they could reinvent things in a such a superior way that they could bring cohesion and forward momentum to a territory where there was a lot of commercial advantages to be had. Whilst I had (and have) respect for everyone involved in the effort I wasn''t afraid to see their prejudices and call them on it. And I''ve not been disappointed in this assessment in the subsequent behaviour of Blogger (ie. Google), SixApart and others as they try to position themselves as controllers of the weblog movement. To me anything that begins with political acromony is usually about power and will not fully address user needs (which by the way are not driven solely by technology limitations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then I''ve added a different perspective and that is in the formative world of weblog APIs. Having built a Java toolkit to easily support publishing to a number of different weblog systems, I am now much more aware of the benefits Atom could potentially bring in this area. In most decisions made by the Atom collective I can see smart people looking at the issues in great details and coming up with some innovative solutions. That said I still don''t see it as a long-term solution because I think the notion of a weblog API will become outdated pretty shortly. Weblogs will not be the end point of web publishing, text will not be the only content and I''m not even sure centralised hosting (of anything but text) will make much sense in the long-term. At some point a standardised web publishing API which deals with the issues of complex data structures with rich meta-data and multimedia content served via peer-to-peer networks will have to be derived. At that point the effort spent on Atom (and getting it adopted) may seem somewhat wasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I want to return to blog syndication formats and the title of this article because I want to highlight the immense difference in the approach taken to modelling computer data formats and physics theoritical models. I have to admit I am outsider in both cases, perhaps an enthusiast but having never been involved in the political games of either my assumptions may be quite wrong. However, as being wrong has never stopped me from putting my suppositions out there before I won''t let it stop me now :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine if syndication was a physical process and physicists were tasked with deriving a good model for describing it. Observation and lot of innate heuristics would be applied to get Syndication Model A which would be tested experimentally and (let''s suppose) found to be a good approximation. However, over time weaknesses, gaps and special cases would arise requiring models A1, A2.. and so on. Eventually some bright spark (or a team of them) would propose model B which would be considered far more authorative fitting all the imperical data thus found. It may also throw up a few questions that could only be proven at a later point as technology developed. Yet the theorem would have several characteristics that would make it adopted (over time) by any serious Physicist. Firstly, it would work with&nbsp;<strong>the existing data</strong>, it would be&nbsp;<strong>logicial consistent within its own constraints</strong>&nbsp;and (if it''s good)&nbsp;<strong>work in harmony with other proven theorems in related idea spaces</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could add that whilst the world of Physics is not devoid of political (and economic) drivers that left unchecked could produce personality (or commercial) driven nonsense the checks-and-balances in place as well as the primary requisite of experimental reproducability and mathemtical soundness ensure, over time, only good theories emerge and are adopted. The Physics world has its own attention and authority market (like the web) which filters out the weeds and the egotistical (and perhaps more effectively). So whilst the latest claim for a human clone or cold fusion reactor might get its moment in the sun, the social and data networks in place ensure its treated with the seriousness it deserves (ie. none).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does the current situation in blog syndication formats differ from this imaginary scenario? Well foremost you might argue that data formats are an art not a science but I disagree. Software code may well be a reflection of personal prejudice and a form of expression with as much to do with communication between programmers as it is about communication man-to-machine. And non-binary data formats certainly make allowance for human observers (hence XML and its structured readability). But the process of data exchange between software should be as much about substance as it is about form and beauty. In any case, the study of human expression is not outside the remits of scientific inquiry and I believe a more scientific approach to finding solutions in this domain has clear advantages. [Additionally, a good physics theorem has form and beauty.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foremost I''d like to highlight the way a model for syndication is derived in the hands of Physicists versus technologists. Logical consistency within itself is something that is something any serious software technology must have but is often missing. Mathematical soundness is also something any algorithmic approach to problem solving should have. Additionally, any new theorem needs to explain known behaviour. In all three cases, I''ll assume over time technologists and Physicists could derive equally competent models judged by these criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the real missing ingredient is the lack of experimental validation . String theorists aside, no serious physical models could claim to be truthful or accurate without experimental validation which can be independently verified. Yet few technologies are developed with this in mind. And I''m not talking about writing a suite of tests to verify that usage of the theorem is correct. I''m talking about validating that the theorem (in this case the syndication format) correctly describes the real-world process of syndication by verifying it in the field, so to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physicists as a whole don''t sit in a room (or a wiki) and decide how they''d like the world to work. They observe it, measure it and sample it to describe how it does work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given with the task of describing how syndication works in the real world they would assemble numerous experiments of real world syndication and perhaps borrow a book from experimental psychologists and do some sampling of the human subjects involved and heck even do some analysis on the software and the network that drives syndication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of yet I don''t see the same care given by the Atom crew to describing how syndicating works but a lot of care given to how they can control how syndication should work for their benefit. In this respect they strike me more as politicians than scientists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To finish on a tangent I''ll quote&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040619084322/http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html\">Joel Spolsky</a>&nbsp;on the whole issue:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>(By the way, for those of you who follow the arcane but politically-charged world of blog syndication feed formats, you can see the same thing happening over there.

Most of us consider the&nbsp;<strong>authority</strong>&nbsp;of a source well in advance of the argument they make (just in the same way, despite our most liberal mindset, we consider the appearance of someone before anything else). However, when authority is the&nbsp;sole&nbsp;filter we apply to information then we expose ourselves as ignorant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truly dangerous part is when we attribute so high an authority to a set of beliefs that they become central to our evaluation of all other information without examination of the validity of the facts and logic of the argument presented. The deeper within the structure of our beliefs these ideas become embedded, the more unshakeable they become despite evidence to the contrary. In fact, when a belief is so central to our identity, every counter-example and evidence to the contrary becomes validation that what we hold so dear must be true and therefore we must change the environment around us to fit with what we know innately to be true despite the consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We learn early on that knowledge given by sources of authority (parent, teachers, moral and political leaders) are useful additions to our limited experiences. However, in adolescence our minds mature to question the validity of beliefs taught to us and re-evaluate these sources of information. Our social ties help us define the network of beliefs we value by promoting those that benefit us socially and rejecting those that harm us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality that makes us grow beyond simply judging ideas based on authority or experience is empathy and ability to project ourselves into situations that are alien to us. To appreciate another person''s point of view we must be able to discard our internal belief system and adopt, temporarily, that of the other person, no matter how abhorent. Not only is this a foundation of civil behaviour but a useful tool in combatting those with whom we disagree. Good strategists need to put themselves into the mindset of their enemy so they can predict their moves without the bias of their own agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When engaged in war, it seems empathy and discussion are the enemy of morale and fortitude. Control of the flow of information and the shutting down of debate are classic tactics in shoring up support for the path undertaken by the leaders of the nation. In this Platonic approach to leadership, lies are necessary truths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet one would hope that the strategists who lead the people themselves don''t abandon rationality and empathy. That they should plan for contingencies of setbacks and even defeat. That they should admit limitations to the power of their forces and acknolwedge the strengths of their enemy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be the Bush administration has done so but all the evidence points to the contrary: Leadership by pompous self-beliefe in rightousness of cause and infallability of spirit. In this respect, they remind me more of the crazed attrition loving generals of WWI then the agonised and dogged leaders of the Allies of WWII.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:53:55','2015-03-05 17:56:23',1,'insular-thinking-and-war','68486eda-aec2-4ac4-9d4b-e12ca4fd51e5',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2004-06-25 21:56:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(38,'Article','Why democracy isn''t the answer to terrorism','monkeyx','<p>It''s been said \"poverty wasn''t what caused a group of middle-class and reasonably well-educated Middle Easterners to fly three airplanes into buildings and another into the ground.

I have to respectfully disagree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I''m obviously not suggesting that democracy in itself is not good thing. However, the perception that given democracy those who currently wage war on the USA would be acquiesced and put down their arms is a sign of the fog of Orientalism clouding people''s vision.</p>\r','\r\n<p>Firstly, the \"middle-class and well-educated Middle Easterners\" who commit terrorism are not interested in democracy. Democracy is something that is one of the reasons why they&nbsp;hate&nbsp;America and the West. For them political power should be divinely given and absolute. Freedom to choose or sack your government is not what those seeking an Islamic theocracy want. The separation of religious life and secular life is as alien to Islamic fundemantilists as it was to Charles I before he had his head chopped off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, from the perspective of Islamic terrorists (or their sympathesisers) the Western model is flawed and it is the exporting of parts (or all of it) to their homeland that is at the heart of their anger. Consumerism, secularism, sexual freedom, gender equality and democratic institutions represent a creeping Westernisation that they witness in their homeland and feel they must fight. The additional antagonism of a foreign military presence or war by infidels on fellow Muslims is the tipping point. The ideological leaders of this movement aren''t ignorant of the Western system. Whilst they may admire its power and its technical supremacy, they despise everything associated with it starting from the dissolution of the extended family and the social structures built in village life to the moral impurity that accompanies expanded freedoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, the history of the Middle East is mired in betrayel and imposition by Westerners. These sins are unforgiveable and whilst economic prosperity and increased liberalisation may quell most people, for many the insults on their honour has gone unpunished on for too long. They don''t merely seek redress for wrongs done, they seek to punish those who committed those wrongs. Nothing short of defeat will sate the ideological leaders of this movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some would argue that whilst democracy and economic liberalisation may not be the complete solution, it can only have a positive effect in reducing the pool of recruits for this movement, following the idiom that a person with their needs met is unlikely to rise up against anybody. However, the Western lifestyle doesn''t fill the spiritual void of Westerners, so how can it possibly substitute a culture where worship of God is indivisible from daily life? How can the shortfalls of Western culture, from the perspective of Muslims, be overcome?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It''s my supposition that in fact as economic liberty and democracy develop (or worse are enforced) on the region the anxiety will only grow. The growing economic inequality (as parts of society do increasingly better) and secularisation will increase the pool of active&nbsp;jihadis&nbsp;seeking to reasssert an Islamic tradition. The first such testbed for this supposition is Iraq where I believe that the situation will get worse&nbsp;after&nbsp;a democratic government is established not better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst generations may pass, the people of the region become better off, the hardcore revanchists will continue to draw upon history and the weaknesses of the Western lifestyle to wage war on the infidels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution is of course to implement change within ourselves, to examine the problems of free societies and to offer solutions without stripping away freedom. The intellectual consensus in the West in the post-Marxist period of social sciences seems to be to abandon all hope of finding a solution, to accept or even embrace the parts of human behaviour that religions have demonised for millenia. Sometimes the religions are so drastically wrong or outdated that it makes sense to bear the cost of educating people out of the dogma of generations. Sometimes however, the visibile impact of such doctrines on society are unpalatable to those who can draw upon the teachings of their ancestors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps though democraticisation of the Middle East is understood to be a two-edged sword by those who advocate the policy. Understanding that this will increase instability and pit brother against brother as secular and religious Arabs fight for political power, they hope to simply relocate the battlefield beyond their own borders. This certainly seems an objective of the Iraq war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final consideration is that given political freedom and democracy, will a non-European culture follow a consensual path which is in harmony with the current world order? It is often dismissed as patronising to suggest Arabs don''t want the same order of things as Westerners. Yet the cultural heritage of the Middle East is quite different and a Reformation is not the only missing ingredient in the development of Islam into a Western style religion or political ideology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That''s not to say Islamic democracies can''t peacefully co-exist with non-Islamic democracies. Yet whilst real differences exist over the West''s moral decadence (from the Islamic perspective) and Israel not to mention the tricky problem of resources (particularly Oil), a truly independent Arab democracy may find it hard to assuage a vocal minority who will continue to view the West as the enemy. Even if the nation state doesn''t get into conflict with the West, it may be sidelined by those who don''t recognise its authority. This can lead to increased policing and decreased freedoms, followed by increasing sympathy for the Islamists'' cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that terrorism has been utilised, its process refined with each subsequent organisation into the global, venture capital driven, decentralised model of today it will be impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. No satisfactory political objective can be met to end it, no compromise or concession given to satisfy those who have the money, organisation and motivation to start terrorist movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sooner or later, I believe people will realise that the war on terrorism is in fact unwinnable. Whilst making the Middle East democratic and its people better off is not a bad goal in itself, it will do nothing to thwart the long-term terrorist threat. And when trying to demoraticise the Middle East, using force is usually worse than the cure. Even in discrete wars with legitimate grounds (such as Afghanistan) the efficacy of the solution is dubious and the costs extremely high.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 17:59:07','2015-03-05 18:00:11',1,'why-democracy-isn-t-the-answer-to-terrorism','0ee283a8-5906-45a0-8c1e-1c85d11f228f',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2004-08-16 22:00:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(39,'Article','Data, Organisation and Metaphors','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">I''ve been struggling with data organisation like most people and I consider it one of the pillars of my role as a developer (the others being communication, processing logic, interfaces, usability, storage and retrieval).

There seems to be a demarcation of boundaries of utility for each approach and overlap in most modern tools.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good websites offer all three (e.g. Amazon, Google) as does good software. It''s even pushing into the operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effort-to-benefit ratio is being tackled via clusters (for content search), decentralised networks and improved analysis tools (for building meta data and categorisation).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So whilst I understand, to some degree, the current approaches and how to implement them I''m left wanting more as far as the metaphors go. Like the metaphors for psychoanalysis which are rooted in a bygone age (ie. the industrial age of the steam engine), data organisation metaphors are remnants of a way of working that I don''t think applies any longer or is sufficient to utilise the power of modern computing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There''s been some developments that seem to suggest a generational change and most of them are derived from the power (and limitations) of hyperlinks. Free association (think wikis), bi-directional flow (think weblogs) and aggregation (think newsreaders) are part of this but they in themselves hinge on a foundation which is struggling between human categorisation (into trees or by time), relational models and machine search (using boolean logic). Tangentially, the role of filters in managing the noise of an open environment makes modern data organisation seem haphazard and sometimes irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst generational change may be on the horizon, I think there are serious obstacles in the sociological and psychological axis. We seem to be highly resistant to such fundamental shifts in our way of thinking, yet surprisingly adept when change is ubiquitous (at least most of us are). We struggle with an abundance of information, yet many of us still cling to old notions of compartmentalising our information. When that proved impossible, we have evolved to compartmentalise the sources of information. We cling to notions of authority as a means of filtering, when its been long established, in the scientific community at least, that truth approximations are best derived via sound logic, mathematics and experimental proofs. Yet to follow that path we would all need expertise and time to evaluate information which is beyond our means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I think data organisation follows two distinct lines, which are incompatible but interlinked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conversational</strong>&nbsp;data models are utilised when there is a broad, possibly rapidly changing, flow of information where a lack of expertise is offset by authority metrics and contextual analysis. The weblog network is the best example of this but any dialogue based exchange fits the bill(email, forums, letters, newspapers, TV news).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Empirical</strong>&nbsp;(structured) data models are applicable when expertise, experimentation and fact-checking are part of the process of both producing and consuming information. Here peer review and decentralised networks for developing emergent categorisation seems to offer a better fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If conversational data models are opinion driven, empirical data models are fact driven. Cross-linking between the two is necessary and often done within one framework. For example, Amazon''s product library is empirical whilst its reviews are conversational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what impact does this distinction have on software design?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well predominantly current models seem to offer meshed solution which relies, in my opinion, to heavily on relational data models in representing conversational data. A typical approach is to model a conversation as a thread (whether that''s a forum thread of messages or a weblog''s list of posts) with directional flow and categorisation in the meta-data attached to the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I''m not convinced this is the right approach. It seems to me we are putting conversational data into a container designed for empirical (structured) data. It surprises me that we use the same underlying technology to represent a product catalogue and a networked communication. Or maybe I''m looking at too low a level, just as if I was looking at the binary machine code and saying the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet when you consider the power of the shifts at the user end when conversational networks were enabled, I think there must be something untapped at the implementation level. Perhaps Google''s virtual file system and approach to data retrieval is closer to what I''m looking for but I think its still predominantly derived from an empirical data model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I''m going to ponder this more no doubt.

Very few people have the time or inclination to obtain expertise in any of the areas of policies that wonksters find endlessly engaging to debate. And more importantly: Expertise in most of the business of government (economics, laws, foreign policy, military, social policy) does not itself lead to a rational choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I''m not discounting the intelligence or wisdom of experts&nbsp;per se. Yet its a fallacy to trust their judgement because a) measuring the effectiveness of political policy is not empirical, b) political efficacy is not measured on a single axis and c) politicians lie. The major problem is often the reductionist approach taken to analysing strategic choices in a complex system where our individual powers of influence are limited. Often the only levers government has to pull are blunt and overarching (e.g. taxation, military invasion, social welfare).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So discounting expertise as an input for electoral choice seems to be the rational decision given the limited scope for any real expert driven decision making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In lieue of expert advice, we only have punditry as a source of analysis and wisdom. Punditry can be as overtly partisan as a newspaper op-ed, church sermon or documentary film or it can be subtle in the way a debate is framed across a media spectrum. For example, focusing several weeks of dialogue on the role of the candidates in a war that took place more than 30 years ago is a sublime piece of punditry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As pundit consumers we generally shop around ''till we find some voice that affirms our own innate beliefs and alignment. We also become selective about the medium we trust. Whether its online news, blogs, sermons in Church / Mosque / Synogogue, TV news, radio talk shows, MTV, late night comedy or whatever. What most of these mediums have in common is that they generally operate as one-way conduits of opinion which makes them uncomfortable to consume for any length of time. We cannot argue how wrong they are with them or condradict the facts or logic that drove them to those conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet consuming punditry is a means by which we arm ourselves for the debates with real people (whether face-to-face or online). The blog medium is a technocratic mechanism that does this very well. Each post says, \"Hey look at this. This is why I believe X. I couldn''t have articulated it myself / Here is how I built my views.\" Each blog is a propaganda channel designed to frame the debate in a way that gives credence to the publishers ideology. The response mechanism is still limited and is rooted in a power struggle between publisher and reader. Cross-linking doesn''t alter this as evolutionary selection generally leads to a network of clusters of opinion which are aligned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta-sites, discussion boards and real life debates offer an opportunity to breakthrough the partisan divide but the same impulse that turns off punditry not in tune with our own beliefs usually means the population at such points of engagement gravitates towards a common political alignment. Exceptions do exist:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20041101084459/http://www.independent.co.uk/\">The Independent</a>''s forums (which I can no longer find) used to have heated and often repeative discussions between Israeli sympathethisers and the (mostly) Muslim anti-Zionists (of which no doubt some were anti-Semitic).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So given expertise, punditry and debate are tools to reinforce or entrench an already established political position&nbsp;most of the time&nbsp;the original questions above seem to be a valid narrowing of how electoral choices are made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK need to examine each of these questions in detail. How is trust gained or lost? How are political alignments established within a social clique? How do societies reach a consensus on a political position (if they ever do)? Big questions but asking them is a good first step (I guess).</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 18:04:08','2015-03-05 18:05:18',1,'how-does-democracy-really-work','bdc20e37-7fe5-46d2-b119-3fbab4ddb5f4',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2004-10-13 22:05:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(41,'Article','Win or Losing the War on Terror','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">I''ve had a lot on my mind of late that''s made me unwilling to blog but I''ve been pondering this question for too long not to ask it here:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do we know if we have won or lost the War on Terror?</strong></p>\r','\r\n<p>I mean by what objectives do we measure success or failure? Here are some I''ve come to dismiss:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>   \r\n  <li><strong>No more terrorism</strong>: Given this is a methodology of persuasion (not necessarily of the victim, or their relations, but of some segment of global opinion), how can it evaporate? It cannot.</li>\r\n   \r\n  <li><strong>No more attacks in the West or against its interests</strong>: OK, a possible outcome but what is the measuring period? If there are no terrorist attacks for a year? Five years? Ten? A century?</li>\r\n   \r\n  <li><strong>End of Islamic extremism</strong>: It seems absurd to assume an ideological strain of any major religion will be eradicated. Christian fundementalism is still with us several hundred years after the Enlightenment.</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some more plausible goals:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>      \r\n  <li><strong>A prosperous, democratic Middle East</strong>: OK, this seems possible. Assuming the major obstacles are removed it could be, even within our lifetime. The obstacles being oil and water, the regimes and conflicts that arise from the hunger to control both.</li>\r\n      \r\n  <li><strong>End of Al-Queda / Capture of Osama bin Laden</strong>: I''m unsure whether a venture capital driven network with extremely loose global ties based on ideology that is unlikely to be eradicated from people''s minds can truly be destroyed. Nor am I certain how much the capture of Osama would bring that about. But I''m willing to assume that its possible the network will be made ineffective if its pool of resources and recruits is limited and its existing structure is targeted to destruction at key nodes which prevent it from reassembling.</li>\r\n      \r\n  <li><strong>Genocide / Thermonuclear Cleansing</strong>: Extreme and immoral but always an option and depending on attitudes (which can change) on the table.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I can''t find a clear articulation by the leaders of the free world on what the end game for this war is. Nor can I find much comfort in other ideological wars (such as on Crime, Drugs and Poverty) which also see fighting between states and networks. At least there is a recognition on these previous American crusades that much of the problem is in the creation of demand at home. In the War on Terror, there is recognition that demand is an issue: Demand for \"freedom\". Which according to supporters of American military intervention means knocking over regimes and putting in place democracies by force of arms, whilst opponents want America to stop supporting friendly-dictatorial regimes and move out of meddling in the region, except in the case of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In fact, you could argue it is America''s \"meddling\" that keeps that latter conflict going: Israel''s viability without American supplies and funds is questionable or at least would have been in the past. Whether it is moral or not to let Israel be destroyed is another matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, all this assumes that the War on Terror is a two-way thing. That whilst the United States and its allies combat Islamic terrorism and the Al Queda network as a threat to their \"way of life\" (read: economic interests) the jihadists equally wage war on the Americans (and all decadent Westerners) in a winner-takes-all duel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This strikes me as patently false. It assumes a fantasism and irrationality on the part of jihadists that may be true at the lowest rungs but cannot possibly be true amongst the minds of the intellectual drivers who incite the war. It certainly hasn''t been true of other Islamic ideologues who fire verbal assaults at the superpower. The real battle for them has always been about the forces of modernisation within their own societies and its commonly acknowledged that Osama''s motives are to capture the Sultanate and end the House of Saud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every tactic employed and every assault on Western symbols has been an effort to do two things:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Show the fallibility and proneness of the Western hegemony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Provoke a response that will galvinise support for the Jihadis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By this measure, ever American military move since September 11 bar one (Afghanistan) has played into their hands. Iraq is everything a Jihadist could want: a location close to home, a continuing stream of propaganda wins, easy targets and diplomatic and moral failure of American power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst the endgame from the American perspective seems clouded and uncertain, that of the Jihadis seem much more clear and achievable. They simply have to see the situation deteriote sufficiently in the region and ordinary Arabs so disenfranchised with modernity that they welcome an Islamic Sultanate that covers the territories parcelled up by Westerners a hundred years ago. They can then try to fortify their people in an effort, which will no doubt prove futile in the end, to bar all Western influences and keep the purity of their Islamic vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For them victory is more achievable because they only have to wait for the Americans to lose credibility within the region and grow tired of pouring lives and wealth into the fires of the Middle East. And as long as they can prevent a democratic Iraq and a lasting peace between Israel and the Arab world they can meet that objective. Of course, they will have harsh new realities to deal with should they succeed. One being the Iranians. The brand of Shia Islam theocracy whilst seemingly indistinguishable from a Westerner''s perspective from that espoused by Arab Sunnis derives from a different source of power and is controlled by different actors. It is not in Iranian interests to see the emergence of unified Arab nation nor the vanquishing of Israel. Iranians who are already subverting their Islamic theocracy in an apolitical, apathetic manner have always been more tuned in with Western values then their neighbours. In fact, the weakness (from the point of Islamic jihadis) of Iranian society is its plurality and multiethnic tolerance. To them it is a weak point for Westernisation to creep into the Islamic polity and an example of how not to run an Islamic theocracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I''m unsure how this will resolve but there is hope for a victory of Western values. The hope lies in a democratic, economic prosperous Iraq; the slow dissolution of Iran''s theocracy into a more benign form of Islamic government; the slow democraticisation of Arab states and the integration of Israel into the region. Yet all of that seems more remote today than it did four years ago. Even the removal of Saddam''s regime has not really advanced this cause significantly because it drained legitimacy from the very blueprint of democratic values that is America.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 18:06:42','2015-03-05 18:07:39',1,'win-or-losing-the-war-on-terror','56a39804-d009-48d1-8bb1-a2791e08256b',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2004-11-16 23:07:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(42,'Article','The Economist review of the software-development industry','monkeyx','<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20041130082626/http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3423238\">This review of the software development industry by the Economist</a>(unfortunately premium content) basically starts with the premise that software development is fundamentally broken and the answer lies in three things:</p>\r','\r\n<ul>   \r\n  <li>Lifecycle management: Basically, iterative approaches such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20041130082626/http://agilemanifesto.org/\">agile programming</a></li>\r\n   \r\n  <li>Better and more automated testing</li>\r\n   \r\n  <li>Open source</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m a fan of agile methodologies and open source as are the majority of programmers, informed managers and designers I know. Better testing is something I’ve born witness to as well: tools such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20041130082626/http://www.junit.org/\">JUnit</a>&nbsp;are now standard as are automated builds with integrated regression testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I’m going to have to nitpick a bit on the Economist. Firstly, I’m unconvinced software development is broken. I’d say it is uneven. Uneven in the sense that the people doing it and the way they do it is in a period of flux as axims which drove software forward in the past no longer apply, at least in some sectors. I mean to suggest that Unix developers are writing broken software or the above three solutions are new to them seems contrary to the history of hacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m also suspect of holding some, admittedly gross and expensive examples of failure as evidence of a general failure within the industry. Notably the worst offenders seem to be in the public sector which would lead me to conclude the public sector’s understanding of what they want their technology to do or even their understanding of the massive behemoth of bueracracy they oversee is lacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m also puzzled why the Economist seems to center the debate around how the big three tool providers (Microsoft, IBM and Borland) will be the salvation and how they are pushing forward the industry towards the above solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, I’d argue after a decade of poor software by these parties its they are who are coming round to what the rest of the industry, and I mean the top hackers wherever they work on code, have shown to be effective solutions. In fact, sidestepping the monstrously burdensome and expensive tools they offer has seen a rise of successful small-to-medium sized projects. That’s purely anecodotal but I’m betting that lots more software gets written now because it is affordable to the do so. Example: Building an effective dynamic web site on the Java platform using open source tools or something on theLAMP&nbsp;enables a lot of developments that would have been too prohibitive to envisage as well as reducing costs in ongoing projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words: I think software development becomes more successful as the fantasist marketing of tool vendors is substituted with real programmers using tools they wrote for each other. Then let Darwin take care of the rest and standards enable interop over established protocols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing missing in the review which I think is glaringly obvious is the poor quality of management that software development suffers from. Both in large projects and small projects the choices of management, especially non-technical management, have a severe impact on success rate. The leadership structure in projects is often a serious point of failure and managing technologists (or if you’re lucky real bona fide geeks) is unlike most other disciplines found in a business environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the best programmers, most agile methods, best-of-breed open source tools and smart automated testing won’t save a project that’s badly scoped and poorly planned.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 18:08:12','2015-03-05 18:08:56',1,'the-economist-review-of-the-software-development-industry','dd4885c4-8c30-4abc-85b2-93119f344ec2',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2004-11-30 23:08:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(43,'Article','Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi','monkeyx','<p>I’ve been meaning to review this wonderful pair of graphic novels which chart the childhood of fellow child of the (Iranian) Revolution Marjane for some time.

Lind</a>&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">which includes the following quote about Iran:</span></p>\r','\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Amazingly, Colin Powell already has launched a repeat of the same strategy that led us to war in Iraq. Based on a single, unvetted intelligence source, he last week accused Iran of attempting to weaponize nuclear warheads to fit on ballistic missiles. It is improbable Iran has any nuclear devises to weaponize (though it is certainly trying to get them, for obvious reasons). But apparently just an accusation is enough to justify preemption. And we recently sold Israel several hundred deep-earth penetrator bombs. It is safe to bet they are not for destroying tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">We may, of course, officially deny any role in a strike on Iran, leaving Mr. Sharon to take full credit. But Iran, which expects such an attack and has prepared for it, already has said it will hold the US as accountable as Israel.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing nothing about war, the neo-cons probably expect any Iranian response to be symmetrical: an air and missile counterstrike. But Iran cannot do much that way, and surely knows it. Why shoot a few ineffective missiles at Israel when you have two juicy targets right next door, in the form of American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Iranian riposte in Afghanistan probably would come slowly, in the form of a guerilla war in that country%u2019s Shiite regions. That might also be Iran%u2019s response in Iraq, where it already has Revolutionary Guard troops in Shiite areas. But there is another possibility. Under the cover of bad weather, which winter often provides, Iran could strike suddenly into Iraq with several armored divisions. Our forces are scattered throughout Iraq, and they cannot mass rapidly because Iraqi guerillas control the roads. With skill that is not beyond what Iran might manage (the Iranian Army is better than Saddam%u2019s was) and a bit of luck, they could roll us up before American airpower could get the clear weather it needs to be effective. America would not only lose a war in Iraq; it would lose an army.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point the analogy I have suggested from the outset would have come to full fruition: Athens’ Syracuse Expedition. Like the Syracuse Expedition, a victory in Iraq would have given America little in the war against its real enemies, Islamic non-state forces. But a defeat that resulted in loss of an entire army would be a catastrophe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the only Syracuse Expedition most neo-cons will know about was a college road-trip to some school in upstate New York. Take it from me, guys; the hangover this time could be a whole lot worse.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s almost inconceivable that Lind’s portrayel of the neocons should be true although past experience certainly adds credibility to it. I mean are they really that stupid?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real danger of Iran’s theocracy utilising the current situation in Iraq and over their nuclear ambitions, which despite all the negotations with the EU seem to be a central part of their foreign policy, will lead to war with the USA. An expensive, devasting war but not beyond plausibility. I mean the mullahs had no qualms about sending sixteen year boys to the front in the Iran-Iraq war as cannon fodder, establishing them as martyrs for the Revolution and entrenching their stranglehold over Iran. A confrontation with the US can only aid them in further pushing back reforms. Do the American’s seriously envisage they can conquer Iran and convert it into a model client state?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s most frightening is that whilst Saddam was either toothless enough or rational enough not provoke the superpower with&nbsp;WMD&nbsp;usage which would galvanise world opinion (and his European creditors particularly), the Iranian mullah’s will not be so timid. Even a devasting response from the USA will only aid their cause and the complete destruction of some Iranian cities will not deter them. Whilst a nuclear strike against anyone but the Israelis seems implausible (and that is probably not an option just yet), chemical weapons deployed against US troops in nearby Iraq or Afghanistan is certainly a grim plausibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the moment, the Iranian government seems to be playing a dangerous game of divide-and-rule in an attempt to capitalise on the growing differences between Europe and the US. Although the Europeans and Americans may be playing a shadow game of their own of good cop / bad cop, it seems likely that when it comes to the crunch the Europeans will flinch and the American’s will see through their belliocose rhetoric. It’s certainly not in Russia’s interest to see American intervention in Iran despite their shared loathing of Islamists. The loss of credibility over Iraq’s WMDs certainly will not favour European support for an adventure into Iran and even Britain’s Prime Minister may not be able to follow lock step in Mr. Bush’s footsteps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet it seems implausible the superpower would get itself into yet another doomed scenario in the Middle East. It will certainly be a true test of the idealism of the neocons and Mr. Bush and we shall see how much reality they allow in their decision making process.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 18:11:26','2015-03-05 18:13:25',1,'last-exit-from-iraq-or-first-entrance-to-iran','5dd05aea-9cd3-4248-9bd4-7c6fc94c60ea',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2004-12-04 23:12:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(45,'Article','The evolving peer sharing organism','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Recently, the&nbsp;RIAA&nbsp;and&nbsp;MPAA&nbsp;or their local henchmen have been attacking peer-to-peer filesharing hubs in an effort to cripple the networks which utilise them.</span></p>\r','\r\n<p>This strategy will no doubt prove successful in the short term but disastrous in the long-term. In targetting hubs, they have employed one of the few direct assault strategies on decentralised networks that can work. It’s pretty well understand networks that normally would remain stable despite the loss of even large numbers of nodes, collapse when a number of key hubs are destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet fundementally, this only works in the short-term in traditional non-evolutionary networks. If the forces driving the network to exist continue to be a factor and the resources needed to build it remain then the network will rebuild itself in due course. A sufficiently determined and well resourced opponent can continue to assault emerging hubs and perhaps by increasing the cost of maintaining the network beyond the benefits of doing so cause a failure of willpower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strategy used in tandem with the assault on network hubs is to partition the key driving nodes from the rest of the network. Legal assaults here serve two purposes: one to remove the worst offenders and two to make an example out of those who would follow in their path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two strategies combined can be devastating on non-evolutionary networks where there exists a tipping point between the costs/risks to network participants and the benefits of the network to consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, both strategies have a fundemental weakness when employed against evolving networks where participants are fundementally intelligent and rationale at a scale not found elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fundemental weakness is that you are forcing the networks to evolve and much more rapidly than they would without your intervention. And the worst thing about evolution is not the fact the next incarnation will be more resilient, it is that a whole host of tangential benefits may improve the usability of the network thus lowering the participation cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem (from the fuedal media system’s perspective) is that engineers working on peer network solutions are generally unconstrained. The full brunt of their intelligence is brought to bare on a problem that is simple for them to define (how to move files from one computer to another). They don’t need to worry about marketing (their opponents in fact do it for them). They do need to worry about legalities but only in so far as making sure they are at least one step removed from the software’s usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, it’s a near-dream technical project for a software engineer which is why so many have worked on it despite the lack of financial incentives. Every failure motivates them and a new generation of engineers to look at it again. The media barons are betting against the smartest people on the planet and whilst no doubt employ some very smart engineers themselves, they are massively outnumbered. [As an aside, what is surprising is how much Western developers have dominated the development of such technology. Either I and a vast number of Westerners are unaware of some pretty hidden networks in Asia and elsewhere or the horde of Indian, Chinese, Korean etc programmers have yet to unleash their own solutions.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution for the media companies is to compromise:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>   \r\n  <li>Reduce the incentives for average consumers to seek out content on peer networks by: a) Lowering the unit cost of media b) Give consumers greater scheduling control (so they can watch content when they want without the outmoded restrictions on broadcasting and geography) b) Offer compelling alternative delivery systems (see iTunes Store)</li>\r\n   \r\n  <li>Accept legitimate content sharing and build business models that can work in such an environment.</li>\r\n   \r\n  <li>Do NOT provoke your consumers into illegal activity.</li>\r\n </ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The last part will no doubt seem wrongheaded to moral and legal purists who see right and wrong clearly partitioned.

Whilst I can certainly respect a person who has spent time in the pursuit of knowledge and I recognise the trinkets of academic office as good indicators of such a person, I’m sceptical that they alone represent expertise as such. For example, on the subject of fishing whose authority would you trust more: the lifelong fisherman (and say his blog) or the professor of fisheries (or agriculture) at some university? Well, the answer depends on the specifics of your question. If we’re talking fishing as a pasttime or trade the former and perhaps if we’re talking about fisheries policy the latter but not automatically. In any case, both offer important points within a dialogue on the subject and both can be considered experts. Identifying the expert by title alone is not sufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the notion that expertise is equivalent to correctness seems absurd. It is at the crux of the problem with traditional media: we accept at face value the words of experts because we cannot evaluate the truth of their words. The explosion of blogs and wikis is a response to this and it doesn’t surprise me that someone in academic circles finds this unpallatable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is not to say there aren’t problems with Wikipedia nor the with the prominence it is getting on the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The author of the article correctly identifies a shallowness in certain areas where contributions from experts would certainly be of benefit. If his reasoning is correct this could be attributed to the unwillingness of experts to defend their contributions against the unwashed masses. Yet if true it says something terrible, if understandable, about academics: that they don’t want to teach! The Wikipedia platform certainly offers many good tools for resolving disagreements and tracking the discussion around specific topics. If experts don’t want to engage in dialogue, I would say it is not Wikipedia that is broken but the cosy academic fortresses that shelter intellectuals from the rigours of argument with a wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authority on the Internet is earned through populism not expertise and is thus the most direct form of democracy. This can certainly mean the wrong consensus can be built and that incorrect ideas can be spread. Just like ideas within the general population. However, unlike the unwired spread of knowledge supporting evidence is a keystone within discussions of merit and the skill of evaluating sources is as fundemental online as it is within academia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One solution to the innate populism of authority can certainly be to partition the network / population, setting standards for participation that exclude most people so that discussion doesn’t retread basic principals. This certainly happens already on the Net and is certainly the model of academic institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the benefit of Wikipedia and the wider web is that non-experts&nbsp;<strong>can</strong>participate often bringing perspective that experts only previously tapped into by means of measuring or sampling opinion. Moreso, non-experts&nbsp;<strong>do</strong>question base principals and as has been shown time and again basic principals change over time. Given the specialisation within academic circles and the closeted nature of research institutions it must be welcomed that non-experts can examine, disagree and offer opinion (and sometimes facts) to enhance the argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the authority model of Internet search and the revision model of wikis, the peer filtering that occurs in academia can be scaled to meet a larger, non-expert populace. Whilst this doesn’t necessarily lead to the exposure of every correct hypothesis and doesn’t preclude invalid consensus, it is certainly a step towards the democratisation of expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, I think academics who fear and mistrust the population producing knowledge and having their knowledge become authorative are simply afraid that they will have to spend time defending their ideas rather than pushing forward into new reaches of knowledge. Such fears of lost time for research whilst understandable should be secondary to the benefits of education. In the end, the public good is served not just by pushing back the frontiers of knowledge but also by bringing the masses along for the ride. The days of transmitting dry facts, and firm consensus, have given way to a more productive dialogue between experts within and outside academic circles.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-05 18:16:31','2015-03-05 18:17:34',1,'expertise-authority-wikipedia-and-the-folly-of-academia','e6f017e4-303f-422c-ac0d-e36af4b17149',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2005-01-02 23:17:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(47,'Article','That was then, this is now','monkeyx','<p>Have you ever looked at an old photo of yourself and tried to remember what you were like then? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine if you could see not just what you looked like but also what you thought at the time as well? In a way, my recent salvaging of my blogs from 2002 to 2005, plus a few writings from 2013, have given me an opportunity to do just that. &nbsp;This isn''t entirely indulgant naval gazing I hope nor a sign of mid-thirties nostalgia, pining for a younger self. Far from it. The past was always rough territory but it stopped being an anchor in the past few years (<em>\"Its getting better all the time\"</em>). Instead, looking at my old writing is in service of two goals: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Get better at writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Get better at thinking.</p>\r','\r\n\r\n<p>I''m not a great writer but I enjoy it and I find I do it for pleasure, especially short stories; to help me understand things and of course, in my professional life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My professional career had early leadership roles, perhaps due to my ability to project certainty, but now its moving in a direction which is less and less about making things directly and more and more about sharing a vision and putting in place the structure to allow others to do that. I still enjoy engineering software myself. The itch to code builds over time and eventually I must write some piece of software or make some kind of game just for the fun of making something out of nothing. My day job, however, is more concerned with thinking and communicating the direction of technology leaving the implementation to those who must decipher my writing. Practice, therefore, will help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its not just for work I want to get better at writing. At school I was always fascinated by history and philosophy but practical needs (we were not a wealthy family) made such a path through higher education risky. Luckily, I was good at, and enjoyed to some degree, science and engineering, particularly physics and computing. Yet, I never fit well into the higher education structure of teaching those subjects. Lectures were boring, maths was dry and labs were trivial. It always felt like a step back and I lost interest. I would instead spend the time reading books about history, politics and philosophy. I failed at bricks-and-mortar institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sixteen-years into a career in software development, I don''t need verification from an institution to do my job. Yet, I like learning - I do it all the time! Formalised education has its appeals. I learned that when I tried to pick up languages without structured learning. However, smart I thought I was, languages (of the human kind at least) are not something I can just get my head around without coaching. There''s a lot of things outside my comfort zone that require formal training. More than this, I want to be able to discuss and share the experience with those on a similar journey. Therefore, I''ve decided to actually to pursue a humanities degree programme whilst working full-time as a technologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stepping out into unfamiliar territory, in an area which I''ve always been interested in but never ventured out into before, has got me really excited. I never needed external validation to read books on history or philosophy but gettting better at analysing them and communicating new ideas needs measurement against some standard; dialogue and insight from those who have made it their living to pursue these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also needs humility and honesty with myself. I put up my old writing on this site, not to laud or roast my thinking but to give me perspective. To understand what has changed and how the process developed over time. Its also, in all honesty, an opportunity to step away from the psuedonym and anonymity of an online persona. To own what I say. (Also, it avoids the \"empty page\" angst of new writing projects. Perhaps that is what I needed most in the short-term.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">I often share with developers I work with something I read that struck a note of truth: \"If you can look at code you wrote 6 months ago and it doesn''t make you wince, you''ve learned nothing.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To myself: If you can read what you wrote 13 years ago and you still think exactly the same, you have not learned enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Teenage Me\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zKGigKe.jpg\" title=\"Teenage Me\" width=\"300\"></p>',NULL,'2015-03-06 12:52:36','2015-03-06 20:56:41',1,'that-was-then-this-is-now','3225e758-8598-432a-92e9-4191a2e2bba0',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-06 05:00:00','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(48,'Article','Moving Day','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The whirling motor-blades of the craft kicked up a thick fog of crimson dust as the rear wheels set on the mud cratered surface. The gravity was thick like soup. The front-wheel thudded to touch, pulling at the safety harnesses of the shaken occupants. The marines, already drained by pulling hard Gs in the descent, unbuckled with relief and checked their gear, loading their packs and rifles. The youngest grunt got out first, heaving and spewing the contents of his stomach until he settled himself. More experienced troopers lurched out after him. If they were comforted by the recruits display they only showed it by friendly taunts and jabbing their fists on his helmet as they passed.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last out of the high-g lander marked SUV-86 was the General: black buttoned up jacket, matching gloves, side-pistol and thick UV goggles worn with an indifferent coolness. As the chopper made its ascent away, he took out a Parejo cigar and cut the end. He took a moment to appreciate the rich smell. Grown and hand wrapped on Jericho, he never took a mission without one at hand. Enjoying it would have to wait until the job was done.&nbsp;</p>\r','\r\n<p>The marines fanned out and secured the landing site as the scout set up the triangulation beacons. The cave entrance leading to the hive was less than two clicks north. The General set the mission timer on his vacuum sealed mechanical watch before giving the barest nod to the squad. They set off in a measured pace, blood thinners working to keep their hearts pumping in the torturously thin atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The countdown reached the first mark and supersonic booms were heard overheard. The squad braced themselves, the mortar stands and magazines were secured on the ground. They watched the flash and smoke ahead before the ground tremors hit them. Lifting the equipment back up, they continued to the cave mouth now billowing out smoke. Putting on their face masks and infrared hooded lamps, they darted in quick motions providing covering support arcs in rotating overwatch guards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their enviro hazard meters flashed warnings about bio contaminants and close proximity fires as they waded through steaming pools of ashen goo and the burned sinews of the hive walls. The fragmented remnants of hive workers and guards lay strewn in a mess of liquified silicate and ooze. The walls were sheared by plasma burns and the clouds of shattered thick carapaces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tunnels stretched deep below the mud flats but the bombers had used precision markers planted weeks beforehand to hone in on their targets. The hive were experts at rooting out human tech but the boffins had doused some workers with crafted genome identifiers that were otherwise benign before reintroducing them back to the collective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hive was not particularly big but it was relatively isolated. It made for a perfect target for the mission. The wasteland of melted organic computers integrated into the structure indicated it had been sophisticated. Its call for help would have a response before the second mission time marker. By which point the General intended to be past the Karman line.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brood chamber lay ahead behind a solid wall of calcified biomass. The workers had thrown themselves into a sacrificial pile a dozen thick to protect the queen from the oncoming superheated plasma. It had worked too, as predicted. Hive were tough sons of bitches. The squad positioned itself into three crossing fire lanes and the scout set thermal detonators at the identified fractures in the obstacle. The personal shield generators held as the explosion roared upwards past the squad, leaving two human-sized entry points. Grenades filled with inhibitor gas were thrown in and the squad followed securing the interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The General stepped inside and stood for a moment, appreciating the defiant posture of the hive queen within. It made a typical display of dominance, rising to its full height and expanding its intricate webwork of wings on its thoracic segments. The effort didn’t illicit so much as a flinch from the steadfast human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Your majesty,” he said curtly. The Terran basic transmitted over short-range subspace. If the tone was sarcastic, nothing of it remained in the translation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The General saw the dim blue light of attached neural receptors activate and knew the queen understood him. The response came after the briefest of pauses, the subspace meta data rich with shrill anger and despair: “Why?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s moving day.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The queen tried to lurch forward, intending a swift motion to decapitate the intruder but inhibitor gas had dulled her awareness. Sonic nets had already pinned her to the spot and her motion only increased the tension and brought the giant form crashing to the ground, anguish and fear distinctively measured by its pheromone release. The marines finalised her restraint by drilling metallic bolt pacifiers into her thorax. The nearby subspace echoed briefly with a tortured scream before unconsciousness took over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the marines dragged their prize out of the caves, the General took off the breathing mask and put the cigar he carried to his mouth. Finding some matches in his breast pocket, he lit and puffed until the tip was a glowing ember. The scout set the communication relay before him and handed him the handset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Come in, Sierra Uniform Victor. This is Scott. The breeder is ready for transport.

The excitement of exploring philosophy and classics, a passion I had from my teenage years onwards, didn''t take much effort to build. I was soon on the <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Open University</a> (OU) website looking at modules and plotting a degree programme. Filling in the necessary forms to enrol and even ordering the books I would first read was wish fulfilment consumerism. All available with a few clicks. Then there would be the waiting until the course started in October. Could I maintain my enthusiasm that long? Would my feverish dreams fall by the wayside? I couldn''t help but recall, out of context, the <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">parable of the Sower</a>.</p>\r','\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I became determined that I would not let this moment''s drive simply fade, subsumed into a passing fad whereupon upon the first real challenge I would stumble and move on to something new. I know myself well enough to know that was a possibility. I also knew, that in the past I have <em>gotten things done</em>. Projects, goals and ambitions have been fulfilled in the face of difficulty and distraction. The key for me was to identify what divided the work I finished and that which I took on a whim and never completed. Sometimes the latter was just what I needed. A learning opportunity; fun, brief and discarded; its only value the experience. If that was to be the case this time, and it may yet prove to be so, it would not be for lack of foresight, planning and hard work. So what distinguished the finished life projects and the ones left <em>in-progress</em> forever?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing I realised I needed to do was to keep the momentum and with it my enthusiasm. I could not simply wait until October to begin! Whatever the structure and barriers to getting started placed before me by the institutions of higher learning, time would not be my undoing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second key to my successful completion of past work was to plan, scope the work at hand, breaking it into units of work I could complete at a pace that would realistically fit into my already busy life. My tendency at times is to rush headlong, try to do it all at once, meet difficulty and once the initial energy expended, become disillusioned that anything would ever be finished. Big goals are scary. I needed lots of small goals to get me through this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the lesson that years of building software has taught me is never try to build the final product in your first attempt. Prototyping is key. I am rusty in academic learning. Reading a lot of things on the internet has conditioned me to soak in information like a sponge. So much of it passes from screen through eyes to mind, that only with serendipity is anything retained at all. I read books in a more measured pace but still it passes in much the same way. Broad strokes of themes and character may lodge themselves as they run through my memories but little more except in the most exceptional of cases. It all forms a tapestry of thought I can draw upon but its not going to cut it for academic learning. For that I would need to retrain my mind, my entire process of evaluating information. So lets get that out of the way first. Lets learn to learn again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equipped with this self-knowledge I began by setting myself some objectives and obtaining some way to test myself along the way. To prove the model. I began by exploring the <a href=\"http://www2.open.ac.uk/students/skillsforstudy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OU''s study skills site</a>. I watched some videos about organising my space and time. I watched videos about effective note taking. Trying various methods, I decided that whilst paper and pen had a tactile quality I enjoyed, realistically for me to fit the method to my day-to-day life I''d need to go electronic. I setup a <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trello</a> board to organise my study tasks. I got <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Evernote</a> to write my notes. Why not apply the tools of the digital age? I may be studying classics but I don''t need the conceit of papyrus to make me feel I''m playing the part. My handsome salt-and-peppered beard would do that just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn''t long before my study board began filling up even though I hadn''t even formally signed up for a university module! The great sea change of further education today is open courseware and given I was planning to study with the OU, what better place to draw my freelance study materials than their <a href=\"http://www.open.edu/openlearn/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Open Learn</a> courses. Abbreviated versions of what I intended to study plus additional modules on classics and philosophy. It was a feast and exploring the short articles, multimedia and activities would sustain my hunger. The Trello cards for books, articles, videos and short modules to read or view piled up into lists stretching from March to September. It was glorious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">A moment before it all got out of hand, I had a heart to heart with my wife Abby about the scope of my ambitions. I outlined the time I would devote to this new obsession and made sincere promises to devote time for her. And as much for my own sanity, agreed to some semblance of a social life by peeking my head out from behind the books and screens. An agreed plan was formed and events booked into the calendar: study days and hours clearly defined. I need a firm hand with my time sometimes as my natural propensity to manically focus on something or vegetate behind a game takes over. Lets not even mention time wasted chasing online cats across a dozen Reddit posts. Thankfully, Google had the tools to keep me in check.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">So fast forward a little time and I have completed the <a href=\"http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/classical-studies/introducing-the-classical-world/content-section-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">second short module</a> from Open Learn. I''ve got my approach to note taking <em>down</em>. My brain has flexed unused grey matter processing simple questions that deceptively open up <a href=\"http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/culture/philosophy/introducing-philosophy/content-section-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">big ideas</a>. The stack of books I''ve ordered from Amazon doesn''t intimidate me, it thrills me. I''m being disciplined about the passage through the material, often forcing myself to simply add the next article or book to the list or card for later consumption rather than getting too lost chasing down the rabbit hole. I''ve not quite managed to stop myself reading outside of my allotted times but I''ve at least tried to keep the overruns to respectable limits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Will it last? Will I complete my quest and get the experience I was after? Will I become distracted or frustrated? I don''t know.

Philosophy is generally perceived as asking important, fundamental and difficult questions about everything. &nbsp;More&nbsp;pejoratively, it is seen as asking “why” endlessly in childlike befuddlement as well as&nbsp;arguing over the meaning of words.</p>\r','\r\n<p>It is true: In the splitting of differences over the meaning of terms, we do find some important distinctions. You cannot ask “Do we have free-will?” and not stumble upon what is meant by “free-will” nor can you tackle the question of “What is political freedom?” without spending a good deal of time examining the meaning of such broad terms as “political\" and “freedom\". So, much of philosophy is about stepping back and asking questions that help define what our searching questions might mean in the first place. It is the meta-discussion about the discussion that allows us to see more clearly what we sometimes take for granted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is philosophy? One answer is it is the \"activity of working out the best way to think about things” (Dr. Dave&nbsp;Ward). It is not always important, we can ponder the best way to think about the most trivial things if we so choose, although the impetus to consider important subjects philosophically is prevalent. It&nbsp;is not always fundamental to consider these questions and stepping back to do so may in fact be harmful to getting the job at hand done. Yet we can benefit from such examination, from the asking “why” and questioning the presuppositions we have built in our understanding. The process of articulating an argument in favour of our conclusions can help in making them more valid&nbsp;(or sound in the jargon of philosophy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was this perennial need to question the core assumptions people take for granted that was at the very heart of the Socratic method&nbsp;and as portrayed in Plato’s Apology, perhaps the reason for Socrates'' trial and execution. The crux of Socrates’ argument in this part of his trial was that we do most good when we examine the virtue of what we think and do; that without such examination our lives are&nbsp;unworthy&nbsp;in their pursuit. There was certainly a religious element to his argument as well, for he believed he was divinely tasked to make such public examinations to benefit the body politic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(&nbsp;It is easy to see why this would be annoying to those constantly quizzed in the public sphere, especially those who considered themselves important. Anyone who has had to answer the ceaseless chains of “why” questions from a child&nbsp;will attest, eventually you tire and in frustration, will resort to a&nbsp;“just because” answer. Imagine how much more the fatigue and embarrassment in answering “why” about your every decision&nbsp;as posed by&nbsp;Socrates with his followers in tow. &nbsp;Of course, it is hard not to read about Socrates and think there was much more to his trial&nbsp;than this, tied up as he was within prophetic zeal and bent towards martyrdom in his old age. )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was Socrates right? And if he was, is there a limit to how much we can examine our lives and our beliefs? Is the idea that we can&nbsp;pursue a right way to think about things flawed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 18th Century philosopher David Hume certainly thought we could not arrive at empirical truth by&nbsp;philosophical&nbsp;examination alone. He wanted us to conform our beliefs with what&nbsp;our senses could observe. In that respect, he famously put the limits on our ability to prove causation, our self or the existence of God. His pessimistic conclusion was encapsulated in his famous words, \"Thus the observation of human blindness and weakness is the result of all philosophy, and meets us at every turn, in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it.”&nbsp;The difficult answer to Hume’s skeptical empiricism was provided by&nbsp;the contemporary Immanuel Kant whose argument could loosely be summed up as: because our minds cannot conceive of a world without causation or self, the structure of the world&nbsp;must conform to our indirect experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the limits, it seems evident by asking the question,&nbsp;“Is this the best way to think about this subject?” we can improve our approach. In my day job, I help make software through a process of management, communication and engineering.&nbsp;In my duties as a manager, I am constantly forced to answer,&nbsp;“Is this the right approach to managing the process? The team? The business?” In communications, there are similar questions and when it comes to engineering, the philosophical questioning is ever present. In fact, I have over the&nbsp;last twenty years witnessed&nbsp;multiple epochal changes in the approach of software development as our understanding of what is good and&nbsp;what is possible has endured repeated examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the use of technology and how technology changes us, we all have the opportunity to examine our lives. The very pace and nature&nbsp;of change&nbsp;gives us cause. Socrates and the contemporary elite in Athenian society had time to ponder, thanks to their status and use of slave labour, deep questions about what it is to be human in this world&nbsp;and the nature of the world and cosmos. We live in a time when many of us, at least in parts of the world, enjoy the same luxury&nbsp;of having time to question&nbsp;our lives. Perhaps we are more distracted&nbsp;and lead more complex lives but the choice to step back and think about why we live the lives we do is there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have the benefit of access to&nbsp;a far greater library of thought than has ever existed in the world before us.&nbsp;Whether the value of this&nbsp;examination is the great virtue Socrates proposes or the lack thereof as dire, we do not have to step back and think alone; to question why without knowing how to answer. It is in short, a good time to study philosophy.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-16 12:34:07','2015-03-16 12:42:36',1,'the-unexamined-life','d1a18650-e53a-478a-8dff-2e0206bb400e',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-16 12:33:55','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(51,'Article','Theogony by Hesiod','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The origin story of the Greek immortals as told by Hesiod in the late 8th Century BC shares similarities with the more familiar works of Homer, the Odyssey and Iliad. It is&nbsp;in the same tradition of heroic epics;&nbsp;told in the same hexameter metre, Ionic dialect and formulaic diction.</span></p>\r','\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hesiod begins with a hymn dedicated to the Muses which compelled him to tell the story of the immortals.&nbsp;The&nbsp;genealogy&nbsp;of the Greek gods then follows. Starting with the primordials (Chasm, Earth, Night etc) it follows with the Titans&nbsp;before describing the ascent of Zeus, the genealogy of the Olympians and finally the special mortals such as Odysseus and Achilles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are clear influences from the east in the writing with elements from the Babylonian&nbsp;epic poem&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ancient.eu/article/225/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Enuma Elish</a>. Only some of the gods described were actually worshipped in ancient Greece. Some of the personified abstractions are used to bridge the genealogy-as-cosmogyny creation myth whilst others are given names for the first time by Hesiod. The Muses, Fates and Graces being particular examples of Hesiod’ extrapolating from sources of the more common stories of his time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interspersing the often long and tedious list of names-followed-by-short-descriptive-phrases are stories that&nbsp;are probably already familiar to someone interested in Greek myths or even those who have seen them borrowed in speculative fiction. Little effort is spared in giving sometimes spurious etymology to the names which&nbsp; Hesiod clearly&nbsp;considered important. It is hard to take all but the most obvious meanings, such as those gods named after places,&nbsp;seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stories sometimes are used to explain the divine origin of&nbsp;cultural rituals prevalent at the time. The story of Prometheus giving fire to mankind is well known but the preceding story of him trying to trick Zeus with the worst parts of an Ox provided an explanation of the practice of giving the worst parts of an animal as sacrifice to the gods. I won’t dwell too much on Zeus’ punishment for mankind in return for the gift Prometheus except&nbsp;to say the Greek literary&nbsp;idea that women were a curse from the gods to confound men appears in other sources as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that Hesiod was pious in his worship of Zeus, feting him with the most complimentary adjectives. Zeus is resourceful, powerful, wise and so on. This is despite the very petty and violent nature of his deity. Zeus does come out of each tale more or less the victor. In the cultural context from which the Theogony is written the masculine power to destroy, to triumph by strength and deceit, are held in a place of honour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As prose, Hesiod’s style is more stilted than Homer’s and didactic genealogy is difficult to follow, so <a href=\"http://www.theoi.com/TreeHesiod.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this&nbsp;family chart</a> helped immensely. It does provide a good primer for the mythology of ancient Greece, which is the primary reason I read it. Outside of its historical context, I could not find the theology&nbsp;commendable. Even taken as allegorical, which is not necessarily how it was intended (even if Hesiod invented much&nbsp;he may have been sincere), it only offers an understanding of the cosmos as cruel; life as a struggle where the strong should do as they please and heroes are little more than murderous savages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet it is hard not to be&nbsp;interested in reading one of the earliest literature describing so many mythological creatures&nbsp;that are used as literary devices for overcoming great and deadly obstacles in the heroic tradition. Its compact length and quick pace&nbsp;makes it worthwhile&nbsp;even if my eyes glazed over the&nbsp;genealogy&nbsp;at times, seeking the nuggets of adventure within.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-16 21:57:35','2015-03-23 11:46:54',1,'theogony-by-hesiod','ab6b2851-e8e5-43fa-8fd0-919f4b634297',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-16 21:56:06','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(52,'Article','What do we know?','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Consider, if you will, you are plugged into the Matrix, a computer simulation feeding your brain all the information it receives.

To say I know something it must be true, I must believe it and it must be justifiable (aka the Classical Account of Knowledge). I can’t know something that is false&nbsp;(that is different to knowing something is not so). If I know its true, I must also believe it - I must have accepted the truth of&nbsp;it. Finally, I can’t just know it by a stroke of luck. If I said I knew your age and guessed correctly, just because it is true doesn’t mean I know it. I have to have good reason for my belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example of me knowing something is I could look at the clock on the wall and know it was 9.15pm. I’m justified in that belief&nbsp;and it certainly is true at the time of writing.&nbsp;I certainly believed it. There doesn’t seem to be any luck involved, the clock is fairly reliable and it seems like the right sort of time given its night and I’ve had my dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if the clock had actually stopped 12 hours ago? It just happens based on a stroke of luck I looked at it just at the right time to get the right time out of it. My justification for knowing the time is completely wrong. So did I really know the time? (This is an example of the Gettier Problem after Edmund Gettier who wrote the paper in the ‘60s that blew the Classical Account of Knowledge out of the water).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could niggle at the scenario and try to get around it but its fairly easy to generate new cases&nbsp;that would&nbsp;put you into the same bind. All you need to do is consider a belief that is false but justified and make it true but not due to the justification you made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could say, well OK: to know something I don’t need to be justified in knowing it. But that leaves knowledge as something that is as much irrational as it would be happenstance. Prejudice would be as good&nbsp;as a logical argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet there are no easy answers. One approach is to&nbsp;add a fourth criteria&nbsp;that your belief is not based on false assumptions (Lehrer’s No False Lemmas). We’re then left with a quandary about what an assumption might be. Define it too narrowly and we don’t really form our beliefs by considering such assumptions. I never had a reason to consider the clock in my example had stopped working, it didn’t even factor in my belief as an assumption. Define it too broadly and almost everything becomes suspect. Do my peripheral beliefs in everything from the amount of light at this time of night or when I have my dinner need to be questioned&nbsp;in case they are false assumptions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there we have it. When you start to reflect on what you know, the extent of our knowledge and what knowledge actually is its hard not to have Epistemic vertigo. Scepticism can really make your head spin.</p>',NULL,'2015-03-18 22:02:06','2015-03-18 22:05:52',1,'what-do-we-know','622a8410-f857-44db-816a-3b814d7212b4',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-18 22:01:50','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(53,'Article','Works and Days by Hesiod','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Have&nbsp;you ever had an older brother tell you what you should do,&nbsp;what you should wear, how you should live?&nbsp;Did he call you a lazy bum and bemoan having to share his inheritance with you?

In the first part, Hesiod lays out the mythology and theology of his time and his own beliefs&nbsp;as a means of teaching Perses examples of what is the right way of living.&nbsp;In the second, he takes a moment to&nbsp;counsel kings on what is the right way of ruling. Finally, in the part of the book that seems most hodgepodge and amended over time is a collection of instructions for life around the agricultural season.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The first thing that Hesiod preaches against is strife, envy and laziness. Clearly, he is much aggrieved that Perses doesn’t tend to his farm and household but instead seeks to mooch off his brother.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">He&nbsp;then gives&nbsp;us a longer version of the story of the creation of woman as punishment for men because Prometheus gave mankind the gift of fire. This first woman, Pandora, opens the jar which has stored all the ills that now befalls mankind.&nbsp;Luckily for us, she closes the jar before Hope escapes. (I can’t help but get a little bemused and angry at the way ancient men thought of women&nbsp;and had it built it into much of their theology.)</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The next&nbsp;major piece of mythos is the story of the races of men. First there was the&nbsp;gold men (immortal, beyond all ills) then the silver (a century of childhood&nbsp;but soon dead afterwards, ungodly); bronze (savage hunter-gatherers) through to the age of demigod heroes to the iron age in which Hesiod lived. This view of the arc of history as one of moral decay is common in early theologies. It has also given scholars that followed a way of distinguishing ages. By some coincidence, the technological ages we use today (stone, bronze and iron etc) coincide at one point with Hesiod’s. Both modern scholars and Hesiod placed the start of their respective iron ages around the same period, roughly the time of the conflicts over Troy or c.1250BC.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">In the middle part of the book, Hesiod turns to giving advice to lords and kings on giving justice and their duty to be fair. (One of my favourite turns of phrases is when he repeatedly calls them bribe-swallowers. Politicians don’t change.) He has what must have been fairly sound advice for his time. He advocates against violence and warns against breaking oaths. In his theology, an Oath is a divine being made when an oath is given and which will become resentful (a Nemesis in the Greek) of the oath-breaker. He advocates the rule of law&nbsp;(straight judgements against visitors) and warns against the divine retribution that would befall a community that is otherwise than just. He makes the case for property rights and with his mind on his brother, the virtue of hard work and the value of wealth when it is built through that hard work rather than stolen.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The morality of the ancient&nbsp;Greeks, at least in the pious writings of Hesiod, certainly follows a recipe of learned behaviour that would allow for a functioning and prosperous agricultural society. Yet, it is hard not to read about it and think how limited it must’ve been.&nbsp;Yes, these are all the baselines of a functioning society: don’t kill&nbsp;people because you want to steal their stuff, don’t be an unjust ruler, work hard and so on. But compared to the radicalness of the Christian message (e.g. “love your enemy”)&nbsp;and how transformative that would prove to be, it is hard not to get a sense of the sheer angst of their existence&nbsp;and how little even the most moral people could aspire to when it comes to goodness.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The final part of the book is a long liturgy on successful living over the seasons and days. I cannot truly judge the merits of his agricultural advice nor tell whether his measures and methods in producing such were the tools of his times as valid. I certainly would not use him to start a career in farming even leaving aside modern techniques. The broadness of his advice gives me a sense that there is much hot air being blown and not just in the&nbsp;section where he talks about trading by sea. The pride he feels at having won a poetry competition on his one trip abroad is only part of the reason.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">However, there are are few nuggets of advice that I found amusing and at least worth retelling here, which is how I shall I end this review:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">- “At the start and end of the cask, take your fill, in the middle be sparing\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Trust and mistrust alike have ruined men\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Do not put things off till tomorrow and the next day\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Many are the ills of a workshy man, waiting on empty hope\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Do not make a friend on par with a brother, and if you make one, do not do him ill unprovoked\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Do not be known as a man of many guests or of none\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Do not urinate standing towards the sun\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Rumour is a dangerous thing, light and easy to pick up, but hard to support and difficult to get rid off\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- “Sometimes a day is a stepmother, sometimes a mother”</p>',NULL,'2015-03-19 22:30:45','2015-03-23 11:47:04',1,'works-and-days-by-hesiod','4ef680c0-260c-45ac-8e27-16870f478e87',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-19 22:30:23','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(54,'Article','Antigone (Barbican Theatre)','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">What makes a ruler just?

How should we treat our enemies in their defeat?</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the third and final tragedy of the Theban plays by Sophocles, the nature of justice and the depths of familial love are tested. Ivo van Hove brings this alive in a thrilling production which brings modern visuals and an immersive soundscape to the Barbican theatre in a well-paced and superbly acted performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">WARNING: Spoilers Ahead.</strong><br>\r\n</p>\r','\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The play begins with Antigone (Juliette Binoche) and her sister Ismende&nbsp;(Kirsty Bushell)&nbsp;mourning the death of their brothers, contemplating the curse on their family brought about by their father Oedipus and the new edict by their uncle Kreon, now king, to treat one of their brothers as a traitor. The source of their disagreement is whether they will obey the edict to deny their brother Polyneices funeral rites, a source of great consternation for Antigone. We immediately get a sense of Antigone’s&nbsp;uncompromising&nbsp;nature and the theme of her placing love for her existing family above any future family of her own or her own life. Meanwhile, the more flexible Ismende is as much concerned about saving what remains of her family as she is her own life. It is hard to credit her temperance as a fault against Antigone’s fiery devotion although I suspect the intent is to portray her as mealy-mouthed in comparison.&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">As the chorus prepares for the appearance of King Kreon (Patrick O’Kane, giving a wonderful deliberated delivery that turns to manic anguish&nbsp;eventually), the backdrop of&nbsp;events are explained. With Oedipus’ death one of his sons (Eteocles) assumes control of Thebes and the other (Polyneices) is banished only to arrive later with an army in tow, ready to sack the city. In the fighting, both die tragically at each others hands and their uncle Kreon is the heroic figure that unites the city and restores order. Kreon quickly establishes his principles for rulership: completely obedience of the sovereign and putting the state above everything else, including family. An inflexible pledge that will see him become an&nbsp;uncompromising&nbsp;despot.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Kreon’s will is quickly tested as news of Antigone’s burial of her brother reaches him via one unlucky guard (Obi Abili gives a great comic performance that lightens the mood). We have in the authoritative figure of Kreon the classic portrayal of the corrupting influence of power as even the rational pleas for mercy by his own son go unheeded as do the couched&nbsp;words of disagreement from his fearful advisers. The main&nbsp;questions being asked are: Is the mark of a good ruler his inflexibility and adherence to his own word? Or is it better to be seen as&nbsp;arbitrary&nbsp;but merciful? Is the virtue of the state in its stability or in governing through consent?</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">As events proceed, the justice of Kreon comes into question as his temper casts a wide net. For a moment he considers Ismende culpable as her sister and nearly puts her to death too before relenting.&nbsp;The more others disagree with him, especially those within his own family, the more Kreon feels the victim of treachery and the more tyrannical he appears. Doubling down on his inflexible position&nbsp;becomes his only recourse when faced by opposition&nbsp;to his rule. He paints himself into a corner from which he cannot escape until it is far too late.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The tragedy that unfolds is both predictable and avoidable. It stems from a core belief of the Greeks that pride is the downfall of great men and that humanity has god-given limits that are exceeded at&nbsp;our peril. So it is that by usurping the traditional rites devoted to the “gods below” (Hades etc), Kreon invites disaster on his household and his state. Interestingly, the wrath of the gods plays out by the actions of mortals not through some direct divine intervention. The gods punishment for Kreon is meted out by the hands of those he loves and in doing so, his entire apparatus of power is exposed as being ineffectual.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The lesson of Sophocles'' play are fairly clear today as they must’ve been to the contemporary audience. Pride comes before a fall. Hubris does not extend man’s power to the domain of the divine. Laws are more than dictats&nbsp;made by mortals but originate in some divine truth. And of course, family is the core unit of society.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">In his portrayal of Antigone, we see the virtuous woman who stands against masculine arrogance to honour family and the gods. She sacrifices her own life in the pursuit of natural justice. She embodies a type of hero quite different to those typical male characters&nbsp;in heroic epics who are shown to be foolish and self-destructive both as a prelude to her actions (her brothers), in the dealing with her in her final moments (the people of Thebes) and ultimately, in her vindication upon her death (the tragic outcome&nbsp;that befalls Kreon).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Full credit to the cast and crew for bringing this classic alive in a modernised version that preserved the rich dialogue.

The roleplaying was immersive as I spun the corporate message and I was getting good at it. I was starting to believe my own spin! A bad sign but I was LexCorp’s face and some early relationships that would blossom into long-term partnerships to maximise the synergies of our design-driven product offering….&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Time to step back out of character.</em><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Much of the middle game became a blur of walking all over the (game) world&nbsp;to pimp out our latest upgraded Space Interceptors, plasma weapons, whatever else the science division had concocted to cause terror, I mean bring world peace. I’d be tweeting as I went, passing on gossip, stirring discontent against our corporate rivals, giving plugged in customers first notice of the prices for our latest gizmos. I’d hang around the map tables or linger around discussions between heads of state trying to get the gossip to bring back to corporate HQ. Nobody else in the team had the time to stick their head&nbsp;up and know what was going on. In hindsight, I learned so little (who knew the whales were sentient and in comms with the aliens??). I saw the inklings of peace in the Middle East but the Saudis (one of our MFCs) had warned us against deals with Iran so I was late to congratulate the Ayatollah for the historic accord. The government of Turkey was always trying to extract money out of us and there didn’t seem much of an opportunity to sell weapons to one faction in order to start a war. How is an evil arms-dealing corporation supposed to make the greenbacks with that kind of&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;amongst good-old fashioned enemies??&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">By around turn 7, I’d really got into the groove and well, the salesman job had slowed right down. The French and Germans were reliable business partners but in the end they were small fry compared to our main customer, the USA.&nbsp;Two things had become apparent. We were more minted than anybody else and the country’s were poor, poor, poor. The best move we had made in the game was pivot dramatically to establish the USA as a MFC and then relocate our HQ there. Their generals and spy agencies were a great source of business. The Vice President of the US and myself were often in conference when she wasn’t chasing our CEO for some high value deliverables. This was a country with global aspirations, saving humanity at every turn and we were glad to be greasing the wheels to make it all happen. USA #1!</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">It wasn’t all legitimate business and press relations. On the latter, it became evident early on the press just wasn’t up to the job of dealing with four or five press releases a turn. Worse: other news always trumped us. Who cares about asteroids or abductions in Angola when LexCorp have a new model army to sell you? And won’t anyone think about what those evil AIM guys are up to? Bah!</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Rolling in dough, the CEO finally handed over responsibility over our agents and gave me a pot of cash to spend on secret projects. I must admit I’ve never played a board game where I had absolutely no in-game resources to manage until the late game but it was thrilling. My weapons were my words, my strategic reserves my personal stamina and the only victory points I cared about was being top dog on the share price charts. Yet, now I had cash and agents it took me a while to figure out what to do with them. After being rebuffed by the Chinese government who were in bed with AIM, I decided to focus my power and influence against them. Spies were deployed in the eastern bits of China whilst ethnic divisions exacerbated in western China. I’m pretty sure it didn’t make much difference either way but hey, it was fun!</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">More successful, or at least it would have been if the game had made it to turn 10, was my efforts to manipulate the stock market and bring the share price of our competitors down. As it was, the game ended a turn early, my evil plan never took effect and our CEO, who clearly had lost sight of the value-add to the corporation, was moonstruck and heading into space to meet some pesky aliens!</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">There is a lot&nbsp;more&nbsp;that happened that honestly are all a bit of a haze now. It was intense. The game flowed relatively smoothly once you accepted the fact it was part roleplaying and part semi-organised chaos. My own role was somewhat handicapped by the difficulties with the press game but I was not short of things I could do. The corporations certainly felt really peripheral to the main game and the economics of the game didn’t work well enough. It felt a bit tacked on but kudos to the corporate controls who engaged with us at every step. Less happy with some of the other controls, on the map etc, who seemed to have no time to deal with a corporate guy trying to do actions. I understand they were overloaded but equal treatment to players who were representing countries or aliens would have been nice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Would I play Watch the Skies again? Yes! It was thrilling and such a huge experience that we were still running through things in our minds days later.&nbsp;Hopefully, some of the issues particularly&nbsp;with the press&nbsp;will be resolved in the next version. I’d also end by saying, the game only really got interesting mid-game so may benefit from a quicker&nbsp;acceleration&nbsp;into a more competitive scenario. Yet, given how confused and new most players appeared to be, it would be a hard balance to achieve. As my first megagame, it has really wetted my appetite for more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"twitter-timeline\" href=\"https://twitter.com/corp_mega/favorites\" data-widget-id=\"580318821703131136\">Favorite Tweets by @corp_mega</a>\r\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?''http'':''https'';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script>',NULL,'2015-03-24 10:34:29','2015-03-24 10:44:41',1,'my-short-life-as-a-corporate-shill','928e9b92-1858-4e6e-b1e1-82fdf245e958',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-24 10:34:19','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(56,'Article','What is it to have a mind?','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Will we one day build a computer that can be said to think? To have a mind of its own? There’s been a lot of recent news stories about the dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with eminent scientists and engineers voicing their concerns. But is a thinking machine even possible?&nbsp;What does it mean to say somethings, whether machines or animals, are minded? What in fact do mean when we say we humans have minds?</span></p>\r\n\r','\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">There are some characteristics of the human mind we can arrive at intuitively. The first is our ability to have thoughts about our own thoughts. &nbsp;I can think, “I should put a jumper on its cold.” But then I can go further and think about that very thought and wonder why I had that thought or perhaps dwell on the fact I haven’t just got the jumper by now. The second type of thought is about things. I can plan for the future. I can use my imagination, thinking of things that I have never actually experienced. I can think about the likeness of things&nbsp;or their “aboutness\".&nbsp;The more tricky thing to define is the idea of consciousness: An awareness of myself that comes naturally but is hard to pin down.&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">We have come a long way from Descartes’ </span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Substance Dualism</em><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"> where the mind and matter were considered two distinct substances. Already in his time such a proposition was questioned on the basis of causality: How&nbsp;would&nbsp;an insubstantial mind affect the physical world? Everything observed of the physical world is affected by other physical objects and properties. Yet, there is no denying that thoughts can lead to actions. Descartes also suggested that we can always be sure of our own mind’s existence, how else would we even think&nbsp;otherwise? Whilst we can question the evidence of our senses and therefore everything else in the world, the self is the one thing we can be certain about. </span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">I think therefore I am</em><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">. However, there are arguments against this as well&nbsp;which suggest in fact, we attribute to ourselves things we observe in others first. Studies on primates indicate acknowledgement of the other (when for example hiding theft of food) with no evidence of self-identity (the failure of even smart animals to pass the mirror test).</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">If we remove the need for an immaterial mind and consider a physicalism approach, we could say that the mind is nothing but the current physical state of our brains. So two organism in exactly the same physical brain state would have the same exact mental state as well. This reductionist view of the mind is called </span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Identity Theory</em><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"> and it comes in&nbsp;two flavours. </span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Token based identity</em><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"> means that for every individual person’s mental state there is a corresponding physical state. </span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Type based identity</em><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"> says that each particular type of psychological state corresponds to some particular physical state. The latter is a stronger claim for it means&nbsp;one psychological state, say a stomach pain from bad suishi, would&nbsp;be caused by the same physical state - our brain chemistries and neural synapses would behave in the same way to generate that state of our minds.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The problem with this reductionist view may be it is too narrow and chauvinistic. Hilary Putman put forward the idea that minds may be realised in different ways that are not physically the same. For example, an octopus may behave in a way that suggests that it feels pain when exposed to fire and tries to avoid it. This psychological state of pain and its resultant behaviour cannot be said to match the physical state of a human experiencing pain. An octopus’s brain is quite different to ours.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Therefore, one way to consider the mind is in the functional roles of&nbsp;mental states. We can then tell mental states apart not by what they are composed of physically but what they do. For example, pain may cause avoidance or anxiety regardless of whether we see it in a human or an octopus. It is then alright for minds to have different physical realisers. In fact, we may find&nbsp;minds in things quite different to us - say an extraterrestrial we meet in the future or in fact, a computer we construct. To have a mind then becomes a question of functional complexity. What we are really looking for then is something which exhibits mental states that are complex enough for us to accept them as evidence of a mind.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">One way to test for this sort of complexity was proposed by Alan Turing in his </span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Imitation Game</em><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">. The control game consisted of a man, henceforth called the interviewer, in one room conversing with a man and a woman in another. The&nbsp;interviewer had to determine which of the other two people was a woman. The man would try to lie and the woman would try to help the interviewer make the right guess. The experimental game consisted of a similar scenario but the interviewer now had to distinguish between a computer and a human. This time the computer was the one pretending to be human whilst the human was trying to help the interviewer to correctly guess. The crux of the experiment was if the interviewer failed to guess the human from the computer as often as he failed to guess the man from the woman, computers had&nbsp;exhibited enough functional complexity to be said to have a mind.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Of course, there are many problems with Turing’s test. Firstly, it is a linguistic test and very&nbsp;anthropocentric, testing for qualities we identify in human beings as intelligence. By definition, any animal would fail such a test and are we ready to discount all animals from having a mind?</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The deeper problem with the test is it makes no account for the inner state of the machine taking the test. A great supercomputer with access to a fast search engine may well fake it through the test. Do we think that such a machine is intelligent? That it has a mind?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">This problem with the computer’s ability to understand was articulated by John Searle''s </span><em style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Chinese Room</em><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\"> thought experiment. Locked in a room I could be given a set of files and instructions that I would receive through a letterbox a sheet with a character printed upon it. I&nbsp;should then take the sheet and reference it to a file in one of the cabinets. I would then draw the symbol in that file&nbsp;on a clean sheet and press it back through the letterbox. Unbeknownst to me, the person on the other side would marvel at my accurate translation of the&nbsp;Chinese writing I had received&nbsp;and my acceptable&nbsp;response in Chinese. I may have answered correctly but we wouldn’t say I understood any&nbsp;Chinese! In a similar way, the computer may be able to interpret the syntax of the symbols it processes but it doesn’t necessarily give it any insight into the semantics, or meaning, of those symbols.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The hard problem of AI - to build a thinking machine - has proven intractable and given way to the more practical solution of building smart machines that expertly deal with information on a vast scale and at incredible pace. There is no denying that they can outperform human brains in many ways and this is likely to improve. However, the question of sentience rests more on the self-awareness we associate with human minds. The point at which independent thought may bring&nbsp;machines into conflict with mankind still appears to me a long way off and far from the certainty with which some intellectuals would present it.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">Perhaps our&nbsp;definition of the mind is too narrow in any case and we are not asking what is a mind but in fact, at what point will we accept that things other than humans have minds? It is clear we value the ability to communicate highly and may yet be surprised by what other intelligences we encounter wish to say if anything at all. If they can convince us they are thinking will we be accepting of their sentience if their thoughts are nothing like ours? We project so much of ourselves into this debate&nbsp;I suspect what may be the greatest shock to follow a thinking machine, animal or&nbsp;extraterrestrial&nbsp;is the fact their concerns are nothing like ours or at the very least, their solutions are far different to ours.</span></p>',NULL,'2015-03-24 21:17:12','2015-03-24 21:17:47',1,'what-is-it-to-have-a-mind','e86a540f-6cdb-4e8b-a578-9aa32c249c53',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-24 21:17:05','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(57,'Article','Homeric Hymns','monkeyx','<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">These thirty-four poems collected from ancient Greek manuscripts were originally sung solo in accompaniment with a lyre. They predate their written form but were likely recorded around the same time as Hesiod’s Theogony and the epic poetry of Homer. They are most likely, wrongly attributed to Homer: partly because of their subject matter, partly because they follow the same form of Ionian poetry he employed and sometimes because the poets of the hymns themselves alluded to being Homer. The poems vary in length from short tributes to the attributes of the Greek immortals to fully fledged stories that fit within the same mythos found in Hesiod''s or Homer’s work.&nbsp;Each is performed as a devotional and together they form a picture of the divine as personable yet otherworldly.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r','\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The mythos of the Greeks was a drama of human motives with the twists of divine power that explained the very substance of the world.&nbsp;The hymn to Demeter, goddess of agriculture, tells us how the changes of the seasons came to be and how mortal men would pass through this world to Hades (the god of the underworld) along the trail cut by Persephone, Demeter’s daughter. Within the tale, the goddess Demeter adopts a mortal guise in her very human anguish for the loss of her daughter only to throw it off and curse the lack of vision of humans.&nbsp;She then assumes a very godly approach to solving the problem by denying the world fertility, forcing Zeus to take notice and rectify the mistake. In doing so, we get a glimpse of feminine&nbsp;power in a patriarchal society.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The poems are full of tales of immortals motivated in much the same way as mortals and following similar paths but on a grander scale of power. The distinctions between gods and men lies foremost in the mortality of humans. So it is that even the act of eating meat is a sign&nbsp;of human frailty. Hermes&nbsp;earns his place amongst the immortals of Olympus by foregoing his hunger for meat as much as his cleverness in his trade of the tortoise-shell lyre with Apollo. When Zeus wishes to stop Aphrodite making a mockery of the other gods, she is tricked by her own passions to sleep with a mortal and give birth to a human. In doing so, there is a revealing dialogue wherein she examines the different fates that can befall those humans that&nbsp;try to become immortals themselves. A&nbsp;gift and a&nbsp;punishment which only Heracles and a couple of notable&nbsp;others receive without complete despair. For the gods themselves&nbsp;also shun human mortality and frailty&nbsp;as a source of great sorrow. The&nbsp;poets show that the gods are most&nbsp;godlike when they exhibit an uncaring attitude towards mortals except in the receiving of offerings&nbsp;and the whimsical answering of prayers for their own purposes.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The interactions of the Greek gods and the rise of new gods is rich material in the tales told. The brilliance of the order Zeus builds in Olympus is founded on his ability to preclude a new generational rival, a fate that befall the Titans and other gods beforehand. He reaches an accommodation with his siblings and children, giving them spheres of influence that mitigates the need for a direct challenge to his authority. He heads off fate&nbsp;in the way he gives birth to Athena out of his own head whilst angering his wife Hera, goddess of marriage.</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">He is aided in this establishment of order by the virtuous characteristics of his most powerful sons and daughters. So it is that Apollo claims the highest honours from the moment of his birth, becoming patron of lyre and curved bow, the most prestigious technologies of Greek civilisation. His power is such that his birth is feared and his arrival in Olympus a cause of great anxiety. Yet&nbsp;his mother’s disarming welcome and his own will to act as the guiding voice to mortals of the will of Zeus, helps maintain the Olympian order. So in a way that was significantly different to the lives of mortals, one generation of gods kept the reigns of power indefinitely and the society of the immortals remained stable thereafter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The hymns are wonderfully evocative and capture the moment of performance as much as paint the mythology that underpinned ancient Greek beliefs. The translation by Sarah Ruden is contemporary and accessible although occasionally some North American idioms felt&nbsp;a little out of place. Alongside Hesiod’s Theogony we have a compelling picture of how the ancient Greeks saw themselves in relation to the forces of nature they personified in their own image and worshipped&nbsp;as something beyond their own mortal understanding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 22.3999996185303px;\">The&nbsp;Greek gods&nbsp;encapsulated the early&nbsp;Greek&nbsp;ideals of virtue as well as their fears of natural forces. Ultimately they gave credence to the notion that their ways were not our ways, their concerns would never be our concerns. Even when they tried to relate to the gods on mortal terms, localising their origins by geography and differentiating them in aspects of human behaviour, the barrier between the divine and mortal was repeatedly lifted up to explain the incongruous experience of human beings. Zeus&nbsp;may have been all knowing, all powerful but mortals were helpless in the play of immortal forces.&nbsp;The mortal&nbsp;plea for justice and calling upon the better nature of the divine was&nbsp;in constant conflict with the whims of the immortals. The joy, desperation and angst of human life is the undercurrent throughout all the hymns.</span></p>',NULL,'2015-03-31 11:33:20','2015-03-31 11:33:25',1,'homeric-hymns','6432ec6c-c6c4-43ea-a2c1-41e3cc4c503f',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-03-31 11:33:02','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read'),(60,'Article','Fringed','monkeyx','<p><center><img src=\"http://srazavi.com/files/resource/1/medium_fringed.jpg\" alt=\"Fringed\"/></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its the day after our return back to London and I am still in a state of being ‘fringed'': the heady mix of cultural nourishment and physical exhaustion that is the aftermath of trying to cram in as many shows as possible into far too little time. The Edinburgh Fringe has been a showcase of the performing arts every August since 1947 but it was the first time I had gone. There’s a carnival spirit across the old town in those weeks. Seekers of the novel and those seeking an audience struggle in a matchmaking exercise facilitated by small flyers and on-street performances. Hectic and jubilant, not even the endless stairs and heavy downpours can dampen the spirit with so much creativity on tap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOur far more organised travelling companions had made a great game of analysis and planning of their itineraries with an ambitious schedule that exhausted me just looking at their shared google sheet. Instead, I had insisted that we would take a more relaxed approach and allow room for serendipitous encounters. I was prepared to be wooed by the most earnest artists and play the role of patron of the arts like an emperor at the coliseum. Besides, given the sheer numbers of shows and my desire to experience a mixture of art forms, I couldn’t decide our three days in advance. So we picked a couple of shows each day from our friends'' careful analysis and made plans each morning for the rest. If our intent had been for a lighter schedule, we failed miserably in the end as excitement at the various opportunities had us marching quickly from show to show. I’m certain it wasn’t as efficient a way to go about things as possible. Yet, it led to the most memorable experiences we had in our time at the festival. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIts hard not to come away from sampling such a smorgasbord of culture and not be inspired to be creative in your own way. Isn''t it every festival goers right to be a critic and booster? I’ll make no exception in offering some short thoughts on each of the acts we saw although time and order are less important to me. There’s no set path through the experience. There are no ratings either and only a standard warning that your mileage will vary.</p>\r','\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn the low polish but welcoming side of comedy, there was the New Zealand duo that hosted  <strong><a href=\"http://fanfictioncomedy.com/\">\r\nFanFiction Comedy</a></strong> which used the form of shared storytelling using appropriated characters to amuse the audience. It was fun and forgettable in a chilled-out environment. It didn’t try to say anything important nor did they take themselves too seriously. It wasn’t angry, there was no exorcising of demons and it wasn’t pushing a political agenda. It was a bit like spending time with your funny mates and for that I’m grateful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTheir guest storyteller led us to perhaps the most fun and imaginative act we saw: <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/calypso.nights\">Calypso Nights: Juan, Two?</a></strong>\r\nThe Venezuelan mash-up artist was a surreal performance of music, comedy and exploration of the culture and history of the Caribbean. The audience were shaken out of their stuffiness over the hour and in the end were helping the crowd surfing host celebrate with a shot of rum. In the inevitable comparison that comes with trying to relate a unique act, I would have to describe it as Mighty Boosh without the darkness and with more of a conscience. The passion for Caribbean music was infectious and I walked away with a new appreciation of chutney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMuch like Irish comedians and Tory-bashing, musical comedy is available readily at the Fringe and in <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/christreilly\">Christian Reilly: Songs of Insolence</a></strong> we got a high-quality dose of at least two of those things. The country/rock parodies were skilfully performed and it was a laugh-out-loud riot to a packed house. It was one of the definite highlights of the free (or more accurately pay-what-you-feel) fringe but I would struggle to remember any of the songs from the performance. There was a political message but it was nothing particularly original and easy targets make forgettable effigies. The short song-sketch of Oasis was more amusing than the entirety of the songs against predictable targets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe other show that seemed to be a fan-favourite of older Lefties was <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jupitusphillip\">Phill Jupitus</a> is Porky the Poet in Apologist Now!</strong>\r\nAnother free show that was worth a bit of a chip-in with one memorable poem about Phil’s first gig to see Blondie. I realised after the fact that of course my only experience with his comedy was on the now-cancelled Never Mind the Buzzcocks so it was probably not surprising I was most entertained when he was talking about music. Angry shouting against Tories and in praise of Jeremy Corbyn must be be solid crowd-pleasers amongst the greying Labourites that murmured approvingly around us. Like shooting ducks in a barrel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe stand up comedy of <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashleystorrie\">Ashley Storrie</a></strong>, a Glaswegian lass who endured a hot house venue brought many chuckles with her playful self-deprecation and mocking of stereotypes to a packed sweaty room. Her readings from her teenage diary were particularly funny. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe intelligent <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/coreywhitecomedian\">Corey White</a></strong> had one of those hard life stories that can make uncomfortable listening if told without the charm and wit that he clearly exhibited. He gave an honest account of the broken life of a sweet man in search of meaning and love. It was hard not to feel that his journey was far from concluding the neat lessons he wanted to impart. The emptiness that ached throughout the act didn’t make him any less funny. Even in the relatively meaningful art of storytelling, as compared to meth addiction, he might still be searching in the wrong places. It was thought-provoking dark comedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a real contrast to <strong><a href=\"http://phil-mann.com/\">Phil Mann’s Hydrophobia</a></strong> which explored depression and anxiety in ways that besides momentarily enjoyable audience participation fell flat in the humour needed to rise beyond self-pity. The not-far-from-the-surface anger and tonally awkward performance made for uncomfortable viewing at times. It was the only show I came out of wishing I had not gone in (sorry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps the best comedy we saw was performed by <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kieranchodgson\">Kieran Hodgson</a></strong> whose optimistic, autobiographical account of his fandom of Lance Armstrong was rich in character and exceptionally well-paced. A coming of age narrative that explored the loss of role models and the distance between friends as they grow older never drifted into the maudlin or overly sentimental. It was gripping from start to finish and the (only) musical number about the attractions of moving south was particularly hilarious. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe most uniquely Fringe experience we had was when we turned up to see <strong><a href=\"http://www.omidsingh.com/\">Omid Singh</a></strong> and it transpired we were the only audience he had managed to bring to his well-hidden little venue. The initial awkwardness was replaced by some wisecracking conversation that only occasionally strayed into his very funny routine as we had a really fun hour together drinking beers and chatting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://chaostheorycomedy.com/\">Chaos Theory</a></strong>\r\nhad the dubious distinction of being the only sketch comedy show we watched. The concept of randomly arranged sketches led to a varied quality of performance that never really tied together. It was funny if forgettable. I’m not a fan of this type of art as it tends to be overly reliant on puns and visual or auditory gags. This wasn’t the worst I’d seen but neither did it change my mind about the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe <strong><a href=\"http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/\">Festival of the Spoken Nerd</a></strong> put on a sell-out performance of their Just for Graphs cabaret comedy science show with plots, fire and magic numbers. It was nerdy only on the fashionable pop science spectrum but quite entertaining. The songs were a bit vanilla but the adaptation of something from the Wicked musical was a clear hit with the folks behind us if few of the rest of the audience. It made a change compared to everything else we watched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn retrospect, I wish we had seen more theatrical performances as some of the best shows were dramas. The two-man adaptation of <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/of-mice-and-men\">Of Mice and Men</a></strong> was brilliantly acted and captured most of the essence of the John Steinbeck novel. I felt some key scenes from the novel were missing and the emotional draw of Lenny as a character could have been better conveyed if we were allowed more time to dwell on his tender side. The portrayal of George and his complex dependency on Lenny came across clearly but the final scene in the book which had me crying when I was younger, left me a little cold in the play. Where it did much better was in its portrayal of the isolation of migratory workers in the Depression period in the dustbowl of America. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have a lot of respect for the energy and talent of the young actors of <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/threemugsoftea\">Eat Me! Drink Me! Buy Me!</a></strong>\r\nwho put on a reimagining of the Alice in Wonderland story as a critique of modern consumerism. Even if the message was earnest and obvious it was well worth watching for the skilful delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile, the presentation of <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Duck_in_a_Hat\">Terry Pratchett’s Eric</a></strong> sadly suffered from the awful location which between pillars and the actors deciding to perform a good number of bits lying on the ground was difficult to see. Its a good book to adapt and the actor who played Rincewind captured the character nicely. I do look forward, however, to the first adaptation of a Discworld novel that moves beyond the cheap fan-pleasing gags (“Its Death!”, “Its the Luggage!”) and gets something of the nuance and wit of Pratchett’s social commentary that made the series so much more than a series of long running puns. Of course, I speak a die-hard and hard-to-please fan with a poor seat and it was overall a good adaptation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe adaptation of Gogol’s <strong><a href=\"http://www.dittoproductions.co.uk/\">Marriage</a></strong> was a great satire of tradition in a clever comedy of manners that was performed by an experienced cast who made it easy to connect with the caricatures of society types they portrayed. It reminded me somewhat of the Importance of Being Earnest and whilst it felt like it was talking about a bygone age, it managed to feel contemporary and sharp. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe best play we saw was without a doubt <strong><a href=\"http://ucludrama.org.uk/\">Dead Man’s Cell Phone</a></strong> which explored the unknowable nature of other people in a tightly scripted performance that was accompanied by haunting thematic music. The protagonist Jean was sympathetically portrayed but it was Mrs. Gottlieb who I felt stole the show with her excellent characterisation of the emotionally distant, titular dead man''s mother. Whilst the central romantic plot came across as more creepy than tender until the end, the redemptive arc of the main character posthumously was uplifting if unexpected. Excellent production values and believable acting made this the one I would recommend whole heartily to see if you get a chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Fringe was overall an incredible experience and there was too little time and yet too much more and I would probably have been broken in body and mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI will close with the opening words of Juan, who summed it up well:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Eden-burg. Wow. Bootiful.</blockquote>',NULL,'2015-08-17 16:43:36','2015-08-17 17:06:27',1,'fringed','74ee4dc4-61d7-46c9-8758-12f588242ac3',9,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,'2015-08-17 16:43:36','published',NULL,'---\npassword: ''''\n','read');
